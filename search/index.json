[{"categories":["scriptures","development"],"contents":"I am very curious about Hebrew, specially the way the language is hierarchically designed. Tree letter words are commonly known as trilateral roots and the rest of the words are variation of these three letters and categorized under the same family. I am not going to get into these details since it is not the scope of this post.\nLong story short, the journey of trying to learn Hebrew started probably between 2006 to 2008 and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much success at it. Or lets say that the expectations don\u0026rsquo;t match reality =P. So I thought that I could try to somehow start with the most common words in the scriptures and that is what motivated to parse the Aleppo codex and analyze its content in python. I quickly learned that my approach was rather naive given the prefixes that causes variations to the words, even thought the meaning of the word itself is the same.\nThis blog post is a second attempt to tackle the same problem but with a more sophisticated linguistic approach using Text Fabric.\nA corpus of ancient texts and (linguistic) annotations represents a large body of knowledge.\nText-Fabric is a Python package for processing and access a corpus of ancient text and linguistic annotations. In this specific case I am using the Hebrew Bible Database, containing the text of the Hebrew Bible augmented with linguistic annotations compiled by the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer, VU University Amsterdam.\nThe text is based on the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia edited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph, Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker, © 1977 and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.\nThe text-fabric version has been prepared by Dirk Roorda Data Archiving and Networked Services, with thanks to Martijn Naaijer, Cody Kingham, and Constantijn Sikkel.\nIt is amazing to see the work these researchers did compiling all this data and making it public for free. I am very thankful for it.\nI am using a literate programming approach with Doom Emacs and org-mode.\nCreate the virtual environment virtualenv ~/.workon-home/venv-textfabric cd ~/.workon-home/venv-textfabric source ./bin/activate.fish pip install text-fabric pandas requests Activate the virtual environment (pyvenv-activate \u0026#34;~/.workon-home/venv-textfabric\u0026#34;) Load the ETCBC/bhsa dataset Use run-python and ober-eval-block-in-repl to evaluate each block (C-c r at the time being). For the sake of a more practical approach to writing using literate programming the output of the blocks will follow the code.\nfrom tf.app import use import os import collections from itertools import chain A = use(\u0026#34;ETCBC/bhsa\u0026#34;, hoist=globals()) A.indent(reset=True) A.info(\u0026#34;counting objects ...\u0026#34;) for otype in F.otype.all: i = 0 A.indent(level=1, reset=True) for n in F.otype.s(otype): i += 1 A.info(\u0026#34;{:\u0026gt;7} {}s\u0026#34;.format(i, otype)) A.indent(level=0) A.info(\u0026#34;Done\u0026#34;) **Locating corpus resources ...** app: ~/text-fabric-data/github/ETCBC/bhsa/app data: ~/text-fabric-data/github/ETCBC/bhsa/tf/2021 data: ~/text-fabric-data/github/ETCBC/phono/tf/2021 data: ~/text-fabric-data/github/ETCBC/parallels/tf/2021 Text-Fabric: Text-Fabric API 12.0.5 =\u0026gt; https:/annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/cheatsheet.html ETCBC/bhsa/app v3 =\u0026gt; https:/github.com/ETCBC/bhsa/blob/master/app Search Reference =\u0026gt; https:/annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/searchusage.html Data: ETCBC - bhsa 2021 =\u0026gt; https:/ETCBC.github.io/bhsa/ Character table =\u0026gt; https:/annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/writing/hebrew.html Feature docs =\u0026gt; https:/ETCBC.github.io/bhsa/features/0_home Node types: book 39 10938.21 = 100 chapter 929 459.19 = 100 lex 9230 46.22 = 100 verse 23213 18.38 = 100 half_verse 45179 9.44 = 100 sentence 63717 6.70 = 100 sentence_atom 64514 6.61 = 100 clause 88131 4.84 = 100 clause_atom 90704 4.70 = 100 phrase 253203 1.68 = 100 phrase_atom 267532 1.59 = 100 subphrase 113850 1.42 38 *word* 426590 1.00 = 100 Sets: Features: Parallel Passages crossref 🆗 links between similar passages BHSA = Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis book ✅ book name in Latin (Genesis; Numeri; Reges1; ...) book@ll ✅ book name in amharic (ኣማርኛ) chapter ✅ chapter number (1; 2; 3; ...) code ✅ identifier of a clause atom relationship (0; 74; 367; ...) det ✅ determinedness of phrase(atom) (det; und; NA.) domain ✅ text type of clause (?

It was very cool, it allowed to click on any word in combination with a keystroke to get a popup with the translation of that word.\nI miss that feature much to be honest, specially with Hebrew. The interSubs plugin allows to do exactly that, but for the mpv video player and using several webservices.\nHere is an example:\nYou can hover the mouse over different words and you will automagically get the translation of that word.\nBest of all, it integrates really well with my mpv configs, so I can open a youtube video url on my notes system and it will automatically open with mpv and have that feature enabled.

I am using pysword which is a wrapper in python around the Sword project. So I already have the bible modules correctly correctly installed on my computer. I am using several other libs like nltk for natural language processing, and others to generate the plots of the wordcloud I use Arch Linux as my OS. I thought at first of using jupyter notebook to be able to execute blocks. Influenced by my love for Smalltalk, I thought there should be a Melpa package to execute chunks of code and lo and behold, I discovered org-babel-eval-in-repl, which does exactly that\u0026hellip; So I installed it on emacs. With that in mind\u0026hellip; lets start\u0026hellip;\nThis chunk is needed to install jupyter-notebook, which is not used here at this time, but I am looking forward to integrate it with Emacs also.

And I thought, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be cool if I could parse one of the hebrew codexes and get the top 20 most frequent words of a chapter or a book? Well this is an attempt to answer these type of questions.\nHow? So I rolled my sleeves and I thought: I will google the Aleppo codex in plain text so I can download it and later use it for analysis. The problem is, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it\u0026hellip;\nThe next challenge then is, how can I produce a plain text version of the Aleppo codex? I thought about parsing a mysword module, which are in reality a sqlite database so that should be easy\u0026hellip; but then when I was doing something totally unrelated (probably around the bees or my first batch of mead) it hit me\u0026hellip; I have several bibles from the Sword project already installed on my notebook and is all OSS, so\u0026hellip; there is probably a python wrapper around diatheke or similar\u0026hellip; and sure it is =)\nIf you want the technicalities, go read my note on How to parse the Aleppo codex and analyze its content in python.\nBut if you are not a geekie human, you probably are interested only in the results rather than the bits and bytes. This is why I splitted the whole thing in two notes, one more IT related and one more Hebrew related. So here we go, brace yourselves this is probably going to be long.\nI am not sure on how to \u0026ldquo;slice\u0026rdquo; the codex so the chunks makes sense for an analysis, for instance: per chapter? Per book? Per \u0026ldquo;stories\u0026rdquo;? Or even other slicing like Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim. Since it is not clear I will start slicing by books at first.\nAssumptions and limitations Hebrew has some peculiarities one of them being the vowel pointing. This brings a ton of challenges. For the sake of simplicity I had to stick to a codex that does not include niqqud whatsoever. I am not sure if this is a good approach or not because two different words without niqqud can render the same writing yet have totally different meaning.\nAnother problem is that there are words that are trivially known like לא (h2834) or אל (h3882); or words that are not translated yet used very much like את (h7073). I have implemented a filter to have the possibility to skip these words. Not because they are not relevant, the Aleph-Tav has a ton of secrets and importance. But there are mixed together some irrelevant tokens considered as words, like opening and closing brackets and parenthesis or similar. So I implemented a list to ignore these words that are rather known or really irrelevant.\nInteresting findings It was rather interesting to me how fast the repetitions decline on unfiltered words. For instance the most used word is the את (h854) with 7073 occurrences. Yet 30 words later in a row, there is a 90% decline in occurrences, משה (h) with 704 occurrences.\nExperiments organized by sections Full Tanakh - top 20 words - unfiltered Word Count Strong את 7073 h854 יהוה 5611 h3068 אשר 4629 h834 אל 3882 h410 כי 3553 h3588 על 3140 h5921 לא 2834 h3809 כל 2757 h5921 ואת 2190 h854 ישראל 2085 h3479 ויאמר 2043 h559 Related בני 1650 h1123 בן 1607 h1121 ולא 1447 h3809 Related Full Tanakh - Top 50 words - unfiltered The words from above as the top 20, plus the following words\nWord Count Strong לו 1045 h3863 איש 1027 h376 המלך 1014 h4428 בית 1003 h1004 מלך 1000 h4427 הוא 910 h1931 עד 904 h5704 לאמר 897 h559 / 564 לך 871 h הארץ 856 h776 ויהי 808 h אמר 797 h559 דבר 787 h1697 העם 724 h5971 Related וכל 712 h3606 Related משה 704 h4872 שם 681 h8043 מן 661 h4478 לי 660 h הזה 650 h1957 אני 635 h589 יהודה 632 h3063 לפני 615 h3942 להם 607 h3859 אם 607 h518 אלהים 597 h430 אדני 587 h136 דוד 583 h1730 אתה 582 h857 עם 582 h5973 Torah Word Count Strong את 2569 h אשר 1617 h יהוה 1493 h אל 1241 h על 949 h כל 921 h כי 895 h לא 861 h ואת 809 h בני 620 h ויאמר 619 h משה 598 h ישראל 508 h ס 491 h הוא 420 h הארץ 352 h ולא 345 h לו 330 h Experiments organized by books Genesis Word Count Strong את 658 h854 אשר 351 h834 ויאמר 337 h559 אל 335 h410 כי 263 h3588 ואת 205 h854 על 203 h5921 כל 199 h3605 אלהים 150 h430 יוסף 144 h3130 יעקב 142 h3290 יהוה 141 h3068 לא 137 h3809 הארץ 126 h776 לו 126 h3863 ויהי 125 h1961 בני 118 h1123 הוא 110 h1931 אברהם 108 h85 שנה 102 h8141 Conclusion The more I try to know, the less I feel I know\u0026hellip; This coding-linguistic area is fascinating and intreaguing. I feel like a taxonomy of this area is needed.\nThis will probaly take a lot of time, which I don\u0026rsquo;t have. So I want to try to balance between being effective and being efficient. I cannot afford to spend much time with this project but on the other hand the Hebrew language is really really apealing to me. I have yet to find a balance on how to proceed.\nAs part of documenting things I am going to include some very interesting resources that I have found.\nFrom the time I spent researching I would probably go with the BHSA DB. This is a proposed roadmap:\nCheck the ETCBC/course materials for an introduction Check the BHSA/bigTables for Pandas examples and learn how to use it Reevaluate then Also, if focus is more in learning Hebrew, check the Parabible website which looks really lean and straigthforward.\nBible in Hebrew Demo Source: https://www.bibleinhebrew.com/bih/BiH_demo.php?uid=10 Title: Bible in Hebrew Demo Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] See, Hear, and Read the Bible in Hebrew - BibleinHebrew.com Source: https://www.bibleinhebrew.com/bih/ Title: See, Hear, and Read the Bible in Hebrew - BibleinHebrew.com Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] Parabible | Genesis 1 Source: https://parabible.com/Genesis/1 Title: Parabible | Genesis 1 Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] GitHub - jcuenod/awesome-bible-data: 😎 A curated list of generously licensed Bible data.

No they will never be happy, because they are not capable Becoming a personal assistant with many roles like: Parent Chef Home assistant Cheerleader (7) Hiding your feeling and needs You do not feel that you can share your needs It is true, you can\u0026rsquo;t share without getting hurt This pattern is not about survival, but self devaluation and fear of upsetting the narc (8) Rationalizing the relationship to other people or hiding the pattern from others \u0026ldquo;That is normal, right\u0026rdquo; There is a lot of shame, so it is not possible for an empat to talk to others about the relationship in happy terms An empat can describe the relationship as good, and talk about the future fake stuff as it is real Hide the unconfortable stuff or be very vague when talking about the relationship Many empats do not get the support needed since they are offering a \u0026ldquo;good picture\u0026rdquo; of their lives They might not be hearing the dissenting voices, empats are stuck! The patterns of justifications keep going Can this change? It is very effortful for this to change This is why when the empat meets a person that is calm, stable and without drama they might \u0026ldquo;not have a connection\u0026rdquo; The absence of chaos is not recognized as normal. It takes a while to let go those patterns of childhood: Drama = love Abuse = love Invalidation = love It requires to understand the architecture of these relationship and yourself There is so much shame and subsequent self-blame It is not your fault, it is not understanding it Once you understand it, you can change ","permalink":"https://albertdelafuente.com/exobrain/20210327145900-video_notes_8_common_patterns_in_trauma_bonded_relationships/","tags":["psych","trauma"],"title":"Video notes: 8 common patterns in trauma bonded relationships"},{"categories":["parasha"],"contents":" Table of Contents Parasha Shemot / שמות / Names Exodus 1:1 - 6:1 Israel Increases Greatly in Egypt Pharaoh Oppresses Israel The Birth of Moses Moses Flees to Midian Elohim Hears Israel\u0026rsquo;s Groaning The Burning Bush Moses Given Powerful Signs Moses Returns to Egypt Making Bricks Without Straw Elohim Promises Deliverance Footnotes: Isaiah 27:6 - 28:13 Judgment on Ephraim and Jerusalem Footnotes: Isaiah 29:22-23 Jeremiah 1:1 - 2:3 The Call of Jeremiah Israel Forsakes YHWH\\\\ Footnotes: Matthew 22:41-46 Whose Son Is HaMashiach?

They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses. ^{12 }But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel. ^{13 }So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves ^{14 }and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.\n^{15 }Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, ^{16 }“When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” ^{17 }But the midwives feared Elohim and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live. ^{18 }So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and let the male children live?” ^{19 }The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” ^{20 }So Elohim dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong. ^{21 }And because the midwives feared Elohim, he gave them families. ^{22 }Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born to the Hebrews[a] you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”\nThe Birth of Moses *2* Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman. ^{2 }The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. ^{3 }When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes[b] and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank. ^{4 }And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. ^{5 }Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it. ^{6 }When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews\u0026rsquo; children.” ^{7 }Then his sister said to Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” ^{8 }And Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child\u0026rsquo;s mother. ^{9 }And Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. ^{10 }When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, “Because,” she said, “I drew him out of the water.”[c]\nMoses Flees to Midian ^{11 }One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.[d] ^{12 }He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. ^{13 }When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, “Why do you strike your companion?” ^{14 }He answered, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “Surely the thing is known.” ^{15 }When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.\n^{16 }Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father\u0026rsquo;s flock. ^{17 }The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock. ^{18 }When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, “How is it that you have come home so soon today?” ^{19 }They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.” ^{20 }He said to his daughters, “Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” ^{21 }And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah. ^{22 }She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, “I have been a sojourner[e] in a foreign land.”\nElohim Hears Israel\u0026rsquo;s Groaning ^{23 }During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to Elohim. ^{24 }And Elohim heard their groaning, and Elohim remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. ^{25 }Elohim saw the people of Israel\u0026mdash;and Elohim knew.\nThe Burning Bush *3* Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of Elohim. ^{2 }And the angel of YHWH appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. ^{3 }And Moses said, “I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.” ^{4 }When YHWH saw that he turned aside to see, Elohim called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” ^{5 }Then he said, “Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” ^{6 }And he said, “I am the Elohim of your father, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at Elohim.\n^{7 }Then YHWH said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, ^{8 }and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. ^{9 }And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. ^{10 }Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” ^{11 }But Moses said to Elohim, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” ^{12 }He said, “But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve Elohim on this mountain.”\n^{13 }Then Moses said to Elohim, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you,\u0026rsquo; and they ask me, ‘What is his name?\u0026rsquo; what shall I say to them?” ^{14 }Elohim said to Moses, “I am who I am.”[f] And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I am has sent me to you.\u0026rsquo;” ^{15 }Elohim also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘YHWH,[g] the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, has sent me to you.\u0026rsquo; This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations. ^{16 }Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘YHWH, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt, ^{17 }and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.”\u0026rsquo; ^{18 }And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘YHWH, the Elohim of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days\u0026rsquo; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to YHWH our Elohim.\u0026rsquo; ^{19 }But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.[h] ^{20 }So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go. ^{21 }And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty, ^{22 }but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.”\nMoses Given Powerful Signs *4* Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘YHWH did not appear to you.\u0026rsquo;” ^{2 }YHWH said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.” ^{3 }And he said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it. ^{4 }But YHWH said to Moses, “Put out your hand and catch it by the tail”\u0026mdash;so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand\u0026mdash; ^{5 }“that they may believe that YHWH, the Elohim of their fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, has appeared to you.” ^{6 }Again, YHWH said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.”[i] And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous[j] like snow. ^{7 }Then Elohim said, “Put your hand back inside your cloak.” So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh. ^{8 }“If they will not believe you,” Elohim said, “or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign. ^{9 }If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”\n^{10 }But Moses said to YHWH, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.” ^{11 }Then YHWH said to him, “Who has made man\u0026rsquo;s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, YHWH? ^{12 }Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.” ^{13 }But he said, “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.” ^{14 }Then the anger of YHWH was kindled against Moses and he said, “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. ^{15 }You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do. ^{16 }He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as Elohim to him. ^{17 }And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.”\nMoses Returns to Egypt ^{18 }Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” ^{19 }And YHWH said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.” ^{20 }So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of Elohim in his hand.\n^{21 }And YHWH said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. ^{22 }Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says YHWH, Israel is my firstborn son, ^{23 }and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me.” If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.\u0026rsquo;”\n^{24 }At a lodging place on the way YHWH met him and sought to put him to death. ^{25 }Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son\u0026rsquo;s foreskin and touched Moses\u0026rsquo;[k] feet with it and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!” ^{26 }So he let him alone. It was then that she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.\n^{27 }YHWH said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of Elohim and kissed him. ^{28 }And Moses told Aaron all the words of YHWH with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do. ^{29 }Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel. ^{30 }Aaron spoke all the words that YHWH had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. ^{31 }And the people believed; and when they heard that YHWH had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.\nMaking Bricks Without Straw *5* Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says YHWH, the Elohim of Israel, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.\u0026rsquo;” ^{2 }But Pharaoh said, “Who is YHWH, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know YHWH, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.” ^{3 }Then they said, “The Elohim of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days\u0026rsquo; journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to YHWH our Elohim, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.” ^{4 }But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.” ^{5 }And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many,[l] and you make them rest from their burdens!” ^{6 }The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, ^{7 }“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves. ^{8 }But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our Elohim.\u0026rsquo; ^{9 }Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”\n^{10 }So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw. ^{11 }Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.\u0026rsquo;” ^{12 }So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. ^{13 }The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.” ^{14 }And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?”\n^{15 }Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, “Why do you treat your servants like this? ^{16 }No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!\u0026rsquo; And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” ^{17 }But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to YHWH.\u0026rsquo; ^{18 }Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.” ^{19 }The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, “You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.” ^{20 }They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; ^{21 }and they said to them, “YHWH look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”\n^{22 }Then Moses turned to YHWH and said, “O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me? ^{23 }For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.”\nElohim Promises Deliverance *6* But YHWH said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh;

Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude[e] of nations.” ^{20 }So he blessed them that day, saying,\n“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying,\n‘Elohim make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.\u0026rsquo;”\nThus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. ^{21 }Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but Elohim will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. ^{22 }Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope[f] that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”\nJacob Blesses His Sons *49 *Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.\n^{2 }“Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob,\nlisten to Israel your father.\n^{3 }“Reuben, you are my firstborn,\nmy might, and the firstfruits of my strength,\npreeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.\n^{4 }Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence,\nbecause you went up to your father\u0026rsquo;s bed;\nthen you defiled it\u0026mdash;he went up to my couch!\n^{5 }“Simeon and Levi are brothers;\nweapons of violence are their swords.\n^{6 }Let my soul come not into their council;\nO my glory, be not joined to their company.\nFor in their anger they killed men,\nand in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen.\n^{7 }Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce,\nand their wrath, for it is cruel!\nI will divide them in Jacob\nand scatter them in Israel.\n^{8 }“Judah, your brothers shall praise you;\nyour hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;\nyour father\u0026rsquo;s sons shall bow down before you.\n^{9 }Judah is a lion\u0026rsquo;s cub;\nfrom the prey, my son, you have gone up.\nHe stooped down; he crouched as a lion\nand as a lioness; who dares rouse him?\n^{10 }The scepter shall not depart from Judah,\nnor the ruler\u0026rsquo;s staff from between his feet,\nuntil tribute comes to him;[g]\nand to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.\n^{11 }Binding his foal to the vine\nand his donkey\u0026rsquo;s colt to the choice vine,\nhe has washed his garments in wine\nand his vesture in the blood of grapes.\n^{12 }His eyes are darker than wine,\nand his teeth whiter than milk.\n^{13 }“Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea;\nhe shall become a haven for ships,\nand his border shall be at Sidon.\n^{14 }“Issachar is a strong donkey,\ncrouching between the sheepfolds.[h]\n^{15 }He saw that a resting place was good,\nand that the land was pleasant,\nso he bowed his shoulder to bear,\nand became a servant at forced labor.\n^{16 }“Dan shall judge his people\nas one of the tribes of Israel.\n^{17 }Dan shall be a serpent in the way,\na viper by the path,\nthat bites the horse\u0026rsquo;s heels\nso that his rider falls backward.\n^{18 }I wait for your salvation, O Lord.\n^{19 }“Raiders shall raid Gad,[i]\nbut he shall raid at their heels.\n^{20 }“Asher\u0026rsquo;s food shall be rich,\nand he shall yield royal delicacies.\n^{21 }“Naphtali is a doe let loose\nthat bears beautiful fawns.[j]\n^{22 }“Joseph is a fruitful bough,\na fruitful bough by a spring;\nhis branches run over the wall.[k]\n^{23 }The archers bitterly attacked him,\nshot at him, and harassed him severely,\n^{24 }yet his bow remained unmoved;\nhis arms[l] were made agile\nby the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob\n(from there is the Shepherd,[m] the Stone of Israel),\n^{25 }by the Elohim of your father who will help you,\nby the Almighty[n] who will bless you\nwith blessings of heaven above,\nblessings of the deep that crouches beneath,\nblessings of the breasts and of the womb.\n^{26 }The blessings of your father\nare mighty beyond the blessings of my parents,\nup to the bounties of the everlasting hills.[o]\nMay they be on the head of Joseph,\nand on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers.\n^{27 }“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,\nin the morning devouring the prey\nand at evening dividing the spoil.”\nJacob\u0026rsquo;s Death and Burial ^{28 }All these are the twelve tribes of Israel.

There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah\u0026mdash; ^{32 }the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” ^{33 }When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.\n*50* Then Joseph fell on his father\u0026rsquo;s face and wept over him and kissed him. ^{2 }And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. ^{3 }Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.\n^{4 }And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, ^{5 }‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.\u0026rsquo;” ^{6 }And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” ^{7 }So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, ^{8 }as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father\u0026rsquo;s household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. ^{9 }And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. ^{10 }When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days. ^{11 }When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim;[p] it is beyond the Jordan. ^{12 }Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them, ^{13 }for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. ^{14 }After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.\nElohim\u0026rsquo;s Good Purposes ^{15 }When Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” ^{16 }So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: ^{17 }‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”\u0026rsquo; And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the Elohim of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. ^{18 }His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” ^{19 }But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of Elohim? ^{20 }As for you, you meant evil against me, but Elohim meant it for good, to bring it about that many people[q] should be kept alive, as they are today. ^{21 }So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.\nThe Death of Joseph ^{22 }So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father\u0026rsquo;s house. Joseph lived 110 years. ^{23 }And Joseph saw Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph\u0026rsquo;s own.[r] ^{24 }And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but Elohim will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” ^{25 }Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “Elohim will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” ^{26 }So Joseph died, being 110 years old.

And Pharaoh awoke. ^{5 }And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. ^{6 }And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. ^{7 }And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. ^{8 }So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.\n^{9 }Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I remember my offenses today. ^{10 }When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, ^{11 }we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. ^{12 }A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. ^{13 }And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”\n^{14 }Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. ^{15 }And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” ^{16 }Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; Elohim will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”[a] ^{17 }Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile. ^{18 }Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. ^{19 }Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. ^{20 }And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows, ^{21 }but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. ^{22 }I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. ^{23 }Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, ^{24 }and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”\n^{25 }Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; Elohim has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. ^{26 }The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. ^{27 }The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. ^{28 }It is as I told Pharaoh; Elohim has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. ^{29 }There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, ^{30 }but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, ^{31 }and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. ^{32 }And the doubling of Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s dream means that the thing is fixed by Elohim, and Elohim will shortly bring it about. ^{33 }Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. ^{34 }Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land[b] of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. ^{35 }And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. ^{36 }That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.”\nJoseph Rises to Power\n^{37 }This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. ^{38 }And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of Elohim?”[c] ^{39 }Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since Elohim has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. ^{40 }You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command.[d] Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.” ^{41 }And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” ^{42 }Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph\u0026rsquo;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. ^{43 }And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, “Bow the knee!”[e] Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. ^{44 }Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” ^{45 }And Pharaoh called Joseph\u0026rsquo;s name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.\n^{46 }Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. ^{47 }During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly, ^{48 }and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it. ^{49 }And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.\n^{50 }Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. ^{51 }Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. “For,” he said, “Elohim has made me forget all my hardship and all my father\u0026rsquo;s house.”[f] ^{52 }The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For Elohim has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”[g]\n^{53 }The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, ^{54 }and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. ^{55 }When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”\n^{56 }So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses[h] and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. ^{57 }Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.\nJoseph\u0026rsquo;s Brothers Go to Egypt\n*42* When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” ^{2 }And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.” ^{3 }So ten of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. ^{4 }But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. ^{5 }Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n^{6 }Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. ^{7 }Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” ^{8 }And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. ^{9 }And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” ^{10 }They said to him, “No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. ^{11 }We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.”\n^{12 }He said to them, “No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.” ^{13 }And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.” ^{14 }But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you. You are spies. ^{15 }By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. ^{16 }Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” ^{17 }And he put them all together in custody for three days.\n^{18 }On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear Elohim: ^{19 }if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, ^{20 }and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so. ^{21 }Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” ^{22 }And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.” ^{23 }They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. ^{24 }Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. ^{25 }And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man\u0026rsquo;s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.\n^{26 }Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed. ^{27 }And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. ^{28 }He said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that Elohim has done to us?”\n^{29 }When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, ^{30 }“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land. ^{31 }But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we have never been spies. ^{32 }We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.' ^{33 }Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. ^{34 }Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.\u0026rsquo;”\n^{35 }As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man\u0026rsquo;s bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. ^{36 }And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.” ^{37 }Then Reuben said to his father, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.” ^{38 }But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”\nJoseph\u0026rsquo;s Brothers Return to Egypt\n*43* Now the famine was severe in the land. ^{2 }And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” ^{3 }But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.\u0026rsquo; ^{4 }If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. ^{5 }But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.\u0026rsquo;” ^{6 }Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?” ^{7 }They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?\u0026rsquo; What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down\u0026rsquo;?” ^{8 }And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. ^{9 }I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. ^{10 }If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.”\n^{11 }Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. ^{12 }Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. ^{13 }Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man. ^{14 }May Elohim Almighty[i] grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”\n^{15 }So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.\n^{16 }When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” ^{17 }The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house. ^{18 }And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.” ^{19 }So they went up to the steward of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house and spoke with him at the door of the house, ^{20 }and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food. ^{21 }And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man\u0026rsquo;s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us, ^{22 }and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” ^{23 }He replied, “Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your Elohim and the Elohim of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. ^{24 }And when the man had brought the men into Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder, ^{25 }they prepared the present for Joseph\u0026rsquo;s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n^{26 }When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground. ^{27 }And he inquired about their welfare and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” ^{28 }They said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. ^{29 }And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother\u0026rsquo;s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? Elohim be gracious to you, my son!” ^{30 }Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. ^{31 }Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.” ^{32 }They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. ^{33 }And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement. ^{34 }Portions were taken to them from Joseph\u0026rsquo;s table, but Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry[j] with him.\nJoseph Tests His Brothers\n*44* Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men\u0026rsquo;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man\u0026rsquo;s money in the mouth of his sack, ^{2 }and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him.\n^{3 }As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys. ^{4 }They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?[k] ^{5 }Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.\u0026rsquo;”\n^{6 }When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. ^{7 }They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! ^{8 }Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord\u0026rsquo;s house? ^{9 }Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord\u0026rsquo;s servants.” ^{10 }He said, “Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.” ^{11 }Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. ^{12 }And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s sack. ^{13 }Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.\n^{14 }When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground. ^{15 }Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?” ^{16 }And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? Elohim has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord\u0026rsquo;s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.” ^{17 }But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.”\nFootnotes:\nGenesis 41:16 Or (compare Samaritan, Septuagint) Without Elohim it is not possible to give Pharaoh an answer about his welfare Genesis 41:34 Or over the land and organize the land Genesis 41:38 Or of the gods Genesis 41:40 Hebrew and according to your command all my people shall kiss the ground Genesis 41:43 Abrek, probably an Egyptian word, similar in sound to the Hebrew word meaning to kneel Genesis 41:51 Manasseh sounds like the Hebrew for making to forget Genesis 41:52 Ephraim sounds like the Hebrew for making fruitful Genesis 41:56 Hebrew all that was in them Genesis 43:14 Hebrew El Shaddai Genesis 43:34 Hebrew and became intoxicated Genesis 44:4 Septuagint (compare Vulgate) adds Why have you stolen my silver cup? /\n/\nHaftarah Isaiah 61:1-3 | Text:ESV;WLC | Audio:ESV English Standard Version (ESV) [[file:T10%20-%20Miketz%20%7C%20119%20Ministries_files/monkimage.png]]\nThe Year of YHWH\u0026rsquo;s Favor\n*61 *The Spirit of the Lord Elohim is upon me,\nbecause YHWH has anointed me\nto bring good news to the poor;[a]\nhe has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\nto proclaim liberty to the captives,\nand the opening of the prison to those who are bound;[b]\n^{2 }to proclaim the year of YHWH\u0026rsquo;s favor,\nand the day of vengeance of our Elohim;\nto comfort all who mourn;\n^{3 }to grant to those who mourn in Zion\u0026mdash;\nto give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,\nthe oil of gladness instead of mourning,\nthe garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;\nthat they may be called oaks of righteousness,\nthe planting of YHWH, that he may be glorified.[c]\nFootnotes:\nIsaiah 61:1 Or afflicted Isaiah 61:1 Or the opening [of the eyes] to those who are blind; Septuagint and recovery of sight to the blind Isaiah 61:3 Or that he may display his beauty Zechariah 3:1 - 4:7 | Text:ESV;WLC | Audio:ESV English Standard Version (ESV) [[file:T10%20-%20Miketz%20%7C%20119%20Ministries_files/monkimage.png]]\nA Vision of Joshua the High Priest\n*3* Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of YHWH, and Satan[a] standing at his right hand to accuse him. ^{2 }And YHWH said to Satan, “YHWH rebuke you, O Satan! YHWH who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!

Definitely worth reading through, and since it\u0026rsquo;s a series of essays you can easily jump around if any of them doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak to you. Productivity\nYES [95]The Defining Decade by Meg Jay (9/10) It\u0026rsquo;s a guide to not feeling lost in your 30s and 40s from a clinical psychologist who sees young people. It\u0026rsquo;s a must read if you\u0026rsquo;re in your 20s. Some of the research and examples are suspect, but the advice is excellent. College\nYES [104]Pragmatic Thinking and Learning by Andy Hunt (9/10) Probably the best, non-charlatanic book on improving your thinking that I\u0026rsquo;ve found. I only wish I\u0026rsquo;d found it sooner. Learning\nMAYBE [65]Nassim Taleb\u0026rsquo;s AUB Commencement Speech (9/10) \u0026ldquo;For I have a single definition of success: you look in the mirror every evening, and wonder if you disappoint the person you were at 18\u0026hellip; Let him or her be the only judge; not your reputation, not your wealth, not your standing in the community, not the decorations on your lapel.\u0026rdquo; Philosophy\nMAYBE [66]The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss (9/10) Massively influential in my life, giving me the idea that I could pursue my own entrepreneurial projects to sustain myself immediately after college. Haven\u0026rsquo;t gone back to it in a while, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the first books I recommend for someone going down the entrepreneurial path. Entrepreneurship\n[47]Letters from a Stoic by Seneca (10/10) The most important, influential, and quotable lines from the timeless \u0026ldquo;Letters from a Stoic\u0026rdquo; by Seneca Philosophy\n[48]The Cook and the Chef: Musk\u0026rsquo;s Secret Sauce (10/10) The \u0026ldquo;cook vs chef\u0026rdquo; dynamic is one that I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about more and more. WBW gives the best start to finish overview of the difference between reasoning from first principles and following the crowd. Learning\n[49]Seeking Wisdom by Peter Bevelin (10/10) Simply the best book on improving your decision making there is. It\u0026rsquo;s dense and hard to get through if you\u0026rsquo;re not truly interested, but it\u0026rsquo;s well worth it. Decision Making\n[50]Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman (10/10) Everyone needs to read this book. The observations were made in a pre-internet era, and they\u0026rsquo;re 10x as relevant today. Nothing will do more to help cure\u0026hellip; Technology\n[52]The Sovereign Individual by Davidson and Rees-Mogg (10/10) One of those few books where you see the world differently after reading it. The next couple decades of technological advancements will give us unprecedented ability to live in ways that would have been unthinkable 30 years ago. Technology\n[53]Endurance by Alfred Lansing (10/10) Holy shit what a ride! Absolutely amazing story of perseverance and leadership, a must read. Whatever struggles you think you are going through simply cannot compare. Biography\n[54]Gödel Escher Bach by Douglas R. Hofstadter (10/10) This book stretched my mind more than almost any other book I\u0026rsquo;ve read. It\u0026rsquo;s tough at parts, it\u0026rsquo;s long, but you\u0026rsquo;ll come out of it thinking about brains, minds, intelligence, and AI in an entirely new way. Science\n[55]The Elephant in the Brain by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler (10/10) A phenomenal book on understanding your own \u0026ldquo;hidden motivations in everyday life\u0026rdquo; and why we do what we do. Widely applicable to all parts of life, and the kind of explanations you can\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about after reading. Psychology\n[56]The Dialogues of Socrates (10/10) Socrates remains the greatest foundational influence on philosophy, and to understand his method, you have to read his dialogues. The rhetoric is brilliant, and at times, even hilarious. Philosophy\n[57]Principles by Ray Dalio (Book Version) (10/10) Much better organized and fleshed out than the original PDF. It gets very slow in the work principles, definitely skim those based on your interest. The life principles are phenomenal, though. Would highly recommend. Philosophy\n[58]The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker (10/10) The best book on getting your most important work done. Read this instead of every other \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo; book. Productivity\n[59]Principles by Ray Dalio (PDF version) (10/10) Absolutely phenomenal. One of the best and most concise guides to creating an order and direction for your life, from the most successful hedge fund manager in the world. It\u0026rsquo;s short, you can get through it in one sitting, and come back to it regularly. Philosophy\n[60]The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker (10/10) Phenomenal book on how our fear of death is the core of our psychological disturbances, and our motivation for life. It will make you think about why we do things and behave in certain ways in an entirely new fashion, and the language within it is delicious. Philosophy\nMAYBE [75]The Way of the Superior Man by David Deida (9/10) Way of the Superior Man, better than any other book I\u0026rsquo;ve found, made me more comfortable with the important distinctions between masculine and feminine\u0026hellip; Masculinity\nMAYBE [83]Models by Mark Manson (9/10) The best book I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on attraction and dating strategy. It\u0026rsquo;s not about being scummy and pickup-y, rather focusing on becoming a more attractive\u0026hellip; Masculinity\nMAYBE [88]The Truth by Neil Strauss (9/10) Every guy should read this book, especially after reading The Game. It covers the struggle between monogamy and desire, and how Neil experience and dealt with it. Masculinity\nMAYBE [89]Money Master the Game by Tony Robbins (9/10) The best book on personal finance I\u0026rsquo;ve read. Particularly important is the \u0026ldquo;goal setting\u0026rdquo; so you know how much money you\u0026rsquo;re really shooting for. Finance\nMAYBE [97]The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt (9/10) Very much a \u0026ldquo;zero to one\u0026rdquo; book, where after you read it you see the world differently. Extremely helpful meta-tactic for evaluating how to improve systems, and I wish I had read it sooner. Entrepreneurship\nMAYBE [114]The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey (9/10) It\u0026rsquo;s about much more than Tennis. It\u0026rsquo;s about how to get out of your own way so you can perform at your best. How to \u0026ldquo;get out of your head\u0026rdquo; so you don\u0026rsquo;t try to control your unconscious processes with your conscious mind. Kind of like a guide to zen for people who aren\u0026rsquo;t into all of the \u0026ldquo;zen-y\u0026rdquo; parts. Learning\nYES [115]Training the Best Dog Ever by Larry Kay and Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz (9/10) Great book on basic dog training. It was really helpful with learning some of the basic foundational stuff around shaping, training, reinforcement, and especially how to make sure your puppy doesn\u0026rsquo;t develop bad habits. Dog Training\nYES [116]Mastery by Robert Greene (9/10) Learn Robert Greene\u0026rsquo;s step-by-step process for becoming a master of your craft, based on the lessons of the greatest masters throughout history. Learning\nYES [117]Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins (9/10) Any book on self-improvement or harnessing your own psychology written since this one is merely a footnote. You could forego every other pop-psych book, just read this one, and you\u0026rsquo;d be set. Psychology\nMAYBE [118]High Output Management by Andy Grove (9/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book High Output Management Management\nYES [120]How to Take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens (9/10) An excellent intro guide to the \u0026ldquo;Zettlekasten\u0026rdquo; method you can use to take useful notes from everything you read. Strong recommend for improving your note taking and the usefulness of everything you\u0026rsquo;re reading. Learning\nYES [128]Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer (8/10) A fun book about one journalists journey to learn to become a \u0026ldquo;master of memory\u0026rdquo; and ultimately win the US memory championship in under a year. It teaches you how to significantly improve your own memory through the story of his journey, making it both highly tactical and a fun read. Learning\n[129]Lying by Sam Harris (8/10) Don\u0026rsquo;t lie, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth it, here\u0026rsquo;s why. Thinking about how we erode trust through white lies told in front of other people was particularly interesting. Philosophy\n[130]Getting Results the Agile Way by J.D. Meier (8/10) This was one of the first productivity books that really changed how I thought about life and work. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend it for anyone looking for a more robust productivity system. Productivity\n[131]Smartcuts by Shane Snow (8/10) Smartcuts is a useful tool for thinking about problems differently. The most frequent path or obvious path is usually the worst, and if you can approach problems differently using some \u0026ldquo;smartcuts\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll typically do much better, or get to the goal much faster. Learning\n[132]Blue Zones by Dan Buettner (8/10) A great overview of how you can live forever, drawing from what we can learn from the regions of the world where people are more likely to live to 100+ (the Blue Zones). Health\n[133]Decisive by Chip and Dan Heath (8/10) I love Decisive, I think it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most practical \u0026ldquo;decision theory\u0026rdquo; books out there. They break down many of the biases and heuristics covered in other books in a way that makes them easier to manage, instead of simply pointing them out and saying \u0026ldquo;well, have fun!\u0026rdquo; Decision Making\n[134]The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin (8/10) The Art of Learning is a wonderful collection of stories on learning from Josh\u0026rsquo;s own life. It gives a look into the practicing mind of a master, instead of pure prescription. It\u0026rsquo;s less directly tactical than Peak, but it gives you many of the ideas through an ongoing story that\u0026rsquo;s exciting to read. Learning\n[135]As a Man Thinketh by James Allen (8/10) Short, you can read it in an hour, but a motivating meditation on the importance of \u0026ldquo;right thoughts.\u0026rdquo; The belief that powerful thoughts, pointed in the right direction, are the foundation and base on which all happiness and success is built. Reminds me of the power of affirmations. Philosophy\n[136]The Score Takes Care of Itself by Bill Walsh (8/10) Written in short chapters on different ideas for leadership and success in competitive fields, Walsh\u0026rsquo;s memoir on leadership is excellent even if\u0026hellip; Leadership\n[137]How to Think More About Sex by Alain de Botton (8/10) A lovely and quick read on reframing how we think about sexuality. Less practical, more for affecting our mental attitudes towards it and conversations around it. Sex\n[138]Vagabonding by Rolf Potts (8/10) Not convinced you can travel for a long period inexpensively? This is your book! Travel\n[139]Who by Geoff Smart (8/10) An excellent tactical resource on hiring, needs to be re-read when I\u0026rsquo;m actually hiring people. Entrepreneurship\n[140]The Monk and the Riddle by Randy Komisar (8/10) Be happy now, don\u0026rsquo;t put off being happy till later and get stuck on the \u0026ldquo;deferred life plan,\u0026rdquo; ESPECIALLY if you do a \u0026ldquo;high power\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;high-income\u0026rdquo; job. If you already believe that, you don\u0026rsquo;t need this book, but you might enjoy the stories. Entrepreneurship\n[141]The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo (8/10) It\u0026rsquo;s not just about tidying up (though it\u0026rsquo;s an excellent book on that). Underlying it is a powerful philosophy on handling our cluttered lives\u0026hellip; Philosophy\n[142]Discourses by Epictetus (8/10) One of the three pillars of stoic writing, Discourses is interesting since Epictetus was a freed slave. Useful aphorisms and quotes as always with the stoics. Philosophy\n[143]Mistakes Were Made but Not By Me by Carol Tavris (8/10) Fantastic introduction to biases and how to identify them in ourselves and others. Read it! Sort of like the other-minded companion to Paradox of Choice. Decision Making\n[144]Good to Great by Jim Collins (8/10) Primarily about what makes a business great, but also a useful tool for making your own life great. Where do you want to be great, not just have success? Entrepreneurship\n[145]A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking (8/10) Makes you think about\u0026hellip; well everything. Excellent history, highly recommend it. Science\n[146]The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz (8/10) A fantastic resource for someone starting a company, and especially growing one. The nice thing about this book is that it\u0026rsquo;s less on \u0026ldquo;starting a startup\u0026rdquo; and more on all the hard parts that come after, which is a refreshing change. Entrepreneurship\n[147]Hello My Name is Awesome by Alexandra Watkins (8/10) The most useful book on naming that I\u0026rsquo;ve found. Good to read for the stories and examples, but you could also use my summary. Marketing\n[148]How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams (8/10) A fun book of life advice built around stories from Adams\u0026rsquo;s experience becoming a famous cartoonist, among other endeavours\u0026hellip; Biography\n[149]Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (8/10) Always love Taleb. I found this book less practical than Antifragile, but it lays a conceptual groundwork for Black Swan and Antifragile to \u0026ldquo;warm you up\u0026rdquo; for his next books. Decision Making\n[150]Fluent Forever by Gabriel Weinberg (8/10) The best book on language learning that I\u0026rsquo;ve found. You can skip a lot of this if you have full immersion available to you, but either way, the techniques.. Language\n[151]Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz (8/10) Very important! College students are stuck on traditional, \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; paths and end up with jobs they don\u0026rsquo;t like so they can buy shit they don\u0026rsquo;t need to\u0026hellip; College\n[152]10% Happier by Dan Harris (8/10) Great participatory journalism exploring the world of modern mindfulness and meditation. If you\u0026rsquo;re skeptical of the benefits of meditation, especially if\u0026hellip; Mindfulness \u0026amp; Meditation\n[153]Extended Massive Orgasm by Steve Bodansky (8/10) Fantastic resource on moving beyond the typical \u0026ldquo;peak\u0026rdquo; type orgasms, both for men and women. Also a good primer on communicating more\u0026hellip; Sex\n[154]The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene (8/10) It\u0026rsquo;s much more than about sexual seduction, it\u0026rsquo;s about how to seduce anyone, politically, socially, and yes, sexually. Extremely interesting analogs from history, highly recommend it. Masculinity\n[155]The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz (8/10) Want to do something big, or unsure if you should go after something big? You need this book. It is also an excellent book on simply being a better person. Entrepreneurship\n[156]Confessions of a Public Speaker by Scott Berkun (8/10) The best book on public speaking I\u0026rsquo;ve found. If you want to speak better, or improve your confidence speaking, this is for you. Communication\n[157]The Elements of Style by William Strunk (8/10) Some very important lessons for the aspiring writer. The best way to use it is to read through it and find the examples where you can\u0026rsquo;t immediately tell what is wrong, study the explanations, and then apply those learnings to your own writing. Writing\n[158]The Game by Neil Strauss (8/10) Great, compelling story. The parts on pickup and dating aren\u0026rsquo;t as good as a book like Models, but the story here is fantastic. Masculinity\n[159]Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari (8/10) A fun and informative look at modern dating culture. Nothing that \u0026ldquo;new,\u0026rdquo; persay, but having it presented by Aziz makes it fun. Their data is interesting too. Masculinity\n[160]The Lean Entrepreneur by Brant Cooper (8/10) I found this book most useful of the lean startup related books. The roadmap at the end is gold, and worth referring back to regularly when you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what to do at a given stage of growing a business. Entrepreneurship\n[161]Enchiridion by Epictetus (8/10) Epictetus\u0026rsquo;s aphoristic Stoic wisdom. It flows less than other stoic works, naturally, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good reminder of the underlying principles. Aphorisms\n[162]Walden by Henry David Thoreau (8/10) I really loved every part of Walden not about the mechanics of living there. The philosophy is beautiful and empowering, discussing taking your own path, living simply, happiness, and standing out confidently. Skip over the financial statements. Philosophy\n[163]Extraordinary Everyday Photography by Brenda Tharp and Jed Manwaring (8/10) A fantastic resource for finding great photos all around you. Helpful ideas for when you can\u0026rsquo;t travel but want to get practice near home, and for finding more photos in any setting you\u0026rsquo;re in. Photography\n[164]Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus (8/10) An ancient book of stoic wisdom, it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable how many of these aphorisms are common phrases today. Since it\u0026rsquo;s aphorisms, you\u0026rsquo;ll get different things out of it each time, and you can open it to any page and find something to ruminate on. Aphorisms\n[165]The Martian by Andy Weir (8/10) Amazing science and a gripping story. The dialogue can be a little jarring at times, but the quality of the SF more than makes up for it. Fiction\n[166]Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart by Gordon Livingston (8/10) It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting set of reminders on life from someone who\u0026rsquo;s gone through more emotional hardship than most of us ever will. Some might feel familiar, other topics new, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth reading through. Philosophy\n[167]The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi (8/10) The sword fighting lessons aren\u0026rsquo;t as useful, naturally, but the underlying strategy and wisdom is fascinating. A great read for strategy or philosophy. Strategy\n[168]Work Clean (Everything in its Place) by Dan Charnas (8/10) One of the best \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo; books I\u0026rsquo;ve read. It discusses how chefs work, and how you can apply it to your daily life. I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented a number of the strategies into my personal system, and I think most people could benefit from reading through it. Productivity\n[169]The War on Normal People by Andrew Yang (8/10) Is Universal Basic Income a good idea? Yang makes a compelling case in this book that it\u0026rsquo;s at least the best option for a pretty terrible situation. Lots of great statistics and historical data. Politics\n[170]Waking Up by Sam Harris (8/10) I love Waking Up as a compelling argument for meditation and mindfulness for the otherwise non-spiritual person. I think Harris spends too much time bashing on religion, but aside from that, it\u0026rsquo;s excellent. Philosophy\n[171]The Rise of Superman by Steven Kotler (8/10) The best book on getting a basic understanding of Flow states and how to get there. Highly recommend it since it\u0026rsquo;s much more approachable than the landmark book \u0026ldquo;Flow.\u0026rdquo; Psychology\n[172]Managing Oneself by Peter Drucker (8/10) The most successful people manage themselves. Drucker outlines how to do that, including effective questions to ask yourself and others in order to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re playing to your strengths and that everyone is lifting each other up. Not allowing differences to become conflicts. Productivity\n[173]Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Dangerous Idea by Daniel Dennett (8/10) A wonderful book about evolution and what it means for our interpretation of life. It\u0026rsquo;s tough to get through at parts, there\u0026rsquo;s a ~100pg section refuting his critics that you can mostly skip, but it\u0026rsquo;s brilliant and makes you rethink the meaning of life. Science\n[174]In Praise of Idleness by Bertrand Russell (8/10) A must read for anyone who has trouble relaxing, or who works 8+ hours a day. I like re-reading it when I start to feel guilty for not buckling down and working all day every day. Philosophy\n[175]The Art Science and Craft of Great Landscape Photography by Glenn Randall (8/10) Great book on landscape photography, for novices and intermediate photographers alike. Photography\n[176]Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (8/10) My least favorite of the 3 famous stoic philosophers. Still motivational and interesting to read, especially considering these were his reminders to himself while he was essentially emperor of the world. Philosophy\n[177]Maxims and Reflections by Goethe (8/10) A book of aphorisms, it\u0026rsquo;s a useful tool for sparking your own clear thoughts. Aphorisms\n[178]Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk (8/10) Darker and crazier than the movie, though the twist is a little more obvious. Highly recommend it if you enjoyed the movie. Fiction\n[179]Why Don\u0026rsquo;t We Learn From History by B.H. Liddell Hart (8/10) An excellent collection of lessons from history based primarily around warfare. The author died while writing it, unfortunately, but it\u0026rsquo;s still jam packed with insights. History\n[180]The Way of Zen by Alan Watts (8/10) The most helpful overview of Zen Buddhism that I\u0026rsquo;ve come across. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize there was such a difference between Southern Indian Buddhism, and Zen Buddhism, and I realized that I like the style of Zen Buddhism much better. Mindfulness \u0026amp; Meditation\n[181]The CIO\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Breakthrough Portfolio Project Management by Michael Hannan, Wolfram Muller and Hilbert Robinson (8/10) A fantastic productivity resource on how to get more done when you\u0026rsquo;re managing multiple projects. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a CIO (which I\u0026rsquo;m not) you can learn a lot from this book about how to better manage your many projects. Productivity\n[182]What Makes Sammy Run by Budd Schulberg (8/10) The last few pages are amazing\u0026hellip; worth a read for anyone who tends to work hard at the expense of everything else in life. Fiction\n[183]The Dip by Seth Godin (8/10) A helpful little book for figuring out when to stick out your project, and when to quit. I think the most useful piece is learning to distinguish between Dips and Cul-de-Sacs, and keeping in mind that it\u0026rsquo;s not worth being in the middle. Entrepreneurship\n[184]The Nicomachean Ethics by Artistotle (8/10) One of the original works of virtue ethics, this book on living a good life by Aristotle has some great advice on being a good, thriving person, through moderating your excesses and deficiencies and striving to improve yourself. Philosophy\n[185]Emergency by Neil Strauss (8/10) A fun, easy to read journey from zero to full apocalypse readiness. It definitely falls more on the \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; side than the \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo; side, but it provides a good overview of prepping and how you can get started. Fitness\n[186]The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus (8/10) Should we commit suicide? Is life absurd? What is meaningful? This thoughtful essay from Camus makes you question the nature of our existence. Philosophy\n[187]The Millionare Fastlane by MJ DeMarco (8/10) As a heuristic and set of ideas for distinguishing between the \u0026ldquo;slowlane\u0026rdquo; traditional wealth method and the \u0026ldquo;fastlane\u0026rdquo; superior method, it\u0026rsquo;s fantastic. Entrepreneurship\n[188]The Art of Worldly Wisdom by Baltasar Gracian (8/10) A lovely book of aphoristic wisdom. You\u0026rsquo;ll find different parts speak to you on each readthrough. It echoes of the stoics. Aphorisms\n[189]The Trusted Advisor by David H. Maister (8/10) Extremely useful if you do any kind of advice-work, like consulting, freelancing, or working on an agency. Management\n[190]Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (8/10) Great ideas around skin in the game and having some stake in the advice you\u0026rsquo;re getting, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find this book as mind blowing as Antifragile or Black Swan. Still worth a read, though. Philosophy\n[191]Ads Don\u0026rsquo;t Work that Way by Kevin Simler (8/10) We think ads \u0026ldquo;incept\u0026rdquo; us with associations between products and unrelated states of mind or status symbols, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t true. Kevin Simler explains why. Marketing\n[192]Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (8/10) It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly written, deeply complex, confusing as hell, and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably throw it at the wall when it\u0026rsquo;s done. But then you\u0026rsquo;ll kinda go \u0026ldquo;okay\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did that\u0026rdquo; and maybe start it again. Fiction\n[193]The Acceleration of Addictiveness by Paul Graham (8/10) The world is getting more and more addictive. If you don\u0026rsquo;t take direct actions to fight the addictiveness, you\u0026rsquo;ll get swept up in it and lose greater and greater control as the years go on and tech gets better. Technology\n[194]How to Hire the Best People You\u0026rsquo;ve Ever Worked With by Marc Andreesen (8/10) A great overview from Marc Andreesen, of a16z, on how you can hire amazing employees. Management\n[195]The Sales Acceleration Formula by Mark Roberge (8/10) Everything you need to know from The Sales Acceleration Formula, whether you\u0026rsquo;ve already read it or are thinking of reading it for the first time. Sales\n[196]The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks (8/10) An excellent book on high-level investing advice that\u0026rsquo;s likely to shift your thinking in at least one or two key ways. These are each of the \u0026ldquo;important things\u0026rdquo; and their takeaways. Finance\n[197]The Straight Dope on Cholesterol by Peter Attia (8/10) Peter Attia\u0026rsquo;s multi-part series on what you should know about cholesterol may as well be a short book, so I took notes on it as if it were one. Enjoy! Health\n[198]Basic Income, Not Basic Jobs: Against Hijacking Utopia (8/10) This is a great summary from Slate Star Codex about why \u0026ldquo;basic jobs\u0026rdquo; are a terrible idea compared to \u0026ldquo;basic income,\u0026rdquo; despite the amount of positive coverage the idea seems to be getting. Finance\n[199]Digital Minimalism: On Living Better with Less Technology by Cal Newport (8/10) A useful book for reducing your addiction to and reliance on technology, while increasing the benefits you derive from it. Good for being mindful about controlling your tech, instead of letting it control you. Productivity\n[200]The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell (8/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell Philosophy\n[201]Energy and Civilization by Vaclav Smil (8/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book Energy and Civilization by Vaclav Smil. History\n[202]Let My People Go Surfing by Yvon Chouinard (8/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book Let My People Go Surfing by Yvon Chouinard. Entrepreneurship\n[203]Contagious by Jonah Berger (7/10) One of my favorite marketing books, it\u0026rsquo;s a useful overview of why some things catch on, others don\u0026rsquo;t, and how we might better engineer our messages. Marketing\n[204]The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg (7/10) A useful book on improving your habits, but maybe a little over simplistic. Still useful if you want to get more control over your life, though. Productivity\n[205]The War of Art by Steven Pressfield (7/10) A fun quick read on productivity and creativity, beating your \u0026ldquo;inner resistance.\u0026rdquo; Skip the last 1/3 about angels and god. Productivity\n[206]Anything You Want by Derek Sivers (7/10) Full of fun tidbits of philosophy on life and business, this is a great book for anyone who feels overworked and stressed. Entrepreneurship\n[207]The Practicing Mind by Thomas Sterner (7/10) Somewhere between Peak and Zen Mind Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Mind, The Practicing Mind provides a good framework for thinking about your art in a nonjudgemental way. It helps with the spiritual side of skill development, instead of always just focusing on go go go. Learning\n[208]Mate (\u0026ldquo;What Women Want\u0026rdquo;) by Tucker Max (7/10) Not as good on \u0026ldquo;dating\u0026rdquo; as Models, but a very useful book on \u0026ldquo;Being a better guy.\u0026rdquo; The psychology on understanding women\u0026rsquo;s POV in dating was\u0026hellip; Masculinity\n[209]The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene (7/10) All 48 of the Laws of Power, my notes on them, and more details to help you quickly learn or review these timeless lessons from Robert Greene. Strategy\n[210]The E-Myth by Michael Gerber (7/10) The central message is to focus on building your business , such that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t require you. This is an important thing to keep in mind for distinguishing between having a job, and building a business. If your business needs you, it\u0026rsquo;s not a business yet. Entrepreneurship\n[211]Liar\u0026rsquo;s Poker by Michael Lewis (7/10) Mostly it\u0026rsquo;s a great story. Not sure I \u0026ldquo;learned\u0026rdquo; anything, but a fun ride! Finance\n[212]The Post American World by Fareed Zakaria (7/10) Thought provoking on how America might lose its global prominence, and the steps we ought to take to preserve it. Politics\n[213]The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau (7/10) A useful book for someone getting started with microbusinesses, or lifestyle businesses, and wants some more guidance. Nothing revolutionary, though. Entrepreneurship\n[214]I Will Teach You to Be Rich by Ramit Sethi (7/10) A good primer on being smart with your finances, but not as good as Money Master the Game. It is shorter, though, and an easier entry point to being smarter with your savings and investing. Finance\n[215]The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle (7/10) This one is a good reminder of the principles in Peak and Talent Code. It\u0026rsquo;s quick, should only take you an hour, and has some useful tips on improving your skills. If think that if you read this without either of those books complementing it, you\u0026rsquo;d miss out on a lot though. Learning\n[216]It\u0026rsquo;s Even Worse Than it Looks by Thomas Mann (7/10) An interesting (and depressing) overview of the problems in American politics. Even more relevant with the recent Trump shenanigans. Politics\n[217]Global Catastrophic Risks by Nick Bostrom (7/10) An interesting though very dense and heavy book. If you want to become depressed over the potential of going extinct, well, here you go! Technology\n[218]Grain Brain by David Perlmutter (7/10) I think this book is, maybe, a little over the top, but it\u0026rsquo;s compelling. Grains = bad. Especially gluten. Also sugar. Cut them out. Any argument to the contrary is of the \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t prove that\u0026rsquo;s bad\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s good\u0026rdquo; variety. Health\n[219]Hooked by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover (7/10) A useful tool for brainstorming how to make your products more habit forming, and thus addictive. Marketing\n[220]Flash Boys by Michael Lewis (7/10) A scary and interesting overview of the high-frequency trading world. Definitely got me scared for the next potential crash, which I imagine was part of\u0026hellip; Finance\n[221]Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi (7/10) The quintessential networking book. I do find many of these behaviors annoying, though\u0026hellip; Networking\n[222]Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (7/10) This was another one I had a hard time getting into, I think because I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly like any of the characters. Except Levin. Levin was great. Fiction\n[223]The Shallows by Nicholas Carr (7/10) An interesting, and somewhat frightening overview of how our brains are being shaped by the Internet. A compelling case for spending less time \u0026ldquo;surfing.\u0026rdquo; Technology\n[224]The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (7/10) Good history of Franklin\u0026rsquo;s life, but I found it kind of hard to get through at times, likely from the older language. Still worth a read, though, especially for some of his thinking around self-improvement. Also, I never realized how old he was during the revolution! Biography\n[225]The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles (7/10) Many of the ideas in this book were warped into ideologies like The Secret, but the underlying concepts here are good. Finance\n[226]The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant (7/10) It\u0026rsquo;s a great overview of the history of philosophy, told as a story where one set of ideas leads into the next. It\u0026rsquo;s just a bit dense and hard to get through at times. History\n[227]For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway (7/10) I had a hard time getting into this, I know it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;great book,\u0026rdquo; but it didn\u0026rsquo;t grip me. Not sure why not. The ending is exciting though. Fiction\n[228]The Motivation Hacker by Nick Winter (7/10) One of the best \u0026ldquo;bang for your buck\u0026rdquo; productivity books. Many of the concepts are presented elsewhere, but it\u0026rsquo;s a fun way of getting reintroduced to them and a good way of framing productivity. Productivity\n[229]Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari (7/10) Not as good as Sapiens, but an interesting look at where our species might go in the future and what we should watch for over the coming decades. Technology\n[230]Landscape Photography II: Advanced Tools and Techniques on Skillshare (7/10) More good material on landscape photos, going into more detail on different situations than he did in the first part of the series. I think it rambles at times, though, could have used a bit more editing. Photography\n[231]To Sell is Human by Dan Pink (7/10) Useful insights on how to sell in a world with information equality, especially for people who generally don\u0026rsquo;t like \u0026ldquo;Selling\u0026rdquo; (like me). Also lays out the argument that everyone has to become a salesperson of some type now if they wish to advance. Sales\n[232]Own the Day Own Your Life by Aubrey Marcus (7/10) One of the better health / self improvement books I\u0026rsquo;ve come across. It\u0026rsquo;s very no-bullshit and compact, well researched, and fun to read. One of those useful tactical books that can replace at least 3 or 4 less condensed ones. Health\n[233]Mindwise by Nicholas Epley (7/10) Good for breaking down the notion that you have any idea why you do what you do, or why other people do what they do, or that you understand how you or others behave or what you or others think. Basically, we know nothing. Psychology\n[234]Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit by Steven Pressfield (7/10) It\u0026rsquo;s a good book for some writing tips on making your stories more compelling. Especially important in a world with so many information sources competing for people\u0026rsquo;s attention. Very readable, quick, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get some good notes from it. Writing\n[235]Chaos Monkeys by Antonio Garcia Martinez (7/10) Half of why this is so good is the author\u0026rsquo;s own hubris. It\u0026rsquo;d be a dull story without it, but with it, you get an entertaining look at the inner workings of startups and silicon valley tech giants. Biography\n[236]Choke by Chuck Palahniuk (7/10) All sorts of messed up, but a gripping read! If you liked Fight Club then check this out too. Fiction\n[237]American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis (7/10) I\u0026rsquo;ve never come so close to throwing up from reading as I did with this book. Not for the faint of heart. Oddly gripping, but you\u0026rsquo;ll feel guilty for enjoying it. Fiction\n[238]Simple Rules by Donald Sull (7/10) Absolutely essential concept, and one that I\u0026rsquo;ve been a fan of for a while. The book is useful in exploring simple rules and giving examples, but I get the sense they padded it a bit because it could be much shorter. Productivity\n[239]Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It by Kamal Ravikant (7/10) A short, powerful reminder to not be so hard on ourselves, and a few practical techniques for getting in the habit of respecting ourselves and treating ourselves better. Philosophy\n[240]Landscape Photography I: Interpreting Place Through Light on Skillshare (7/10) Quick, and gives you some nice new ways to think about landscape photography. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the different kinds of lighting, so that was helpful, just a little low on details. Photography\n[241]Aphorisms and Thoughts by Napoleon (7/10) More quotations than aphorisms, still some good wisdom here though. It\u0026rsquo;s short, too. You can get through all ~500 in a couple sittings. These ones were my favorites. Aphorisms\n[242]Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau (7/10) Important piece of political philosophy, though I found it a little dull to get through. Might be relevant in the current (2016) political climate\u0026hellip; Philosophy\n[243]Early Retirement Extreme by Jacob Fisker (7/10) An excellent introduction to many of the early financial freedom concepts, it just felt like the narrative drifted too much at parts and had to be skimmed. Definitely some good lessons and takeaways, though. Finance\n[244]College Unbound by Jeffrey Selingo (7/10) Interesting info on how the college system became so messed up, felt fluffed though. College\n[245]The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao (7/10) In this series of essays, Venkatesh explores the workings of organizations through the lens of The Office. Psychology\n[246]How to Invest in Real Estate: The Ultimate Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Getting Started by Brandon Turner, Joshua Dorkin (7/10) The most important notes and details from the beginner\u0026rsquo;s guide to real estate investing from Bigger Pockets Real Estate\n[247]Atomic Habits by James Clear (7/10) The most useful book on changing your habits, more than The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend this book over most books aimed at helping you get control over your life. Productivity\n[248]The Family that Built an Empire of Pain by Patrick Keefe (7/10) A fascinating history of how the Sackler family created the modern opiate epidemic through their work at Purdue pharma, and how they\u0026rsquo;ve tried to cover it up. Well worth the long read. Health\n[249]Can\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Me by David Goggins (7/10) An extremely motivating and fun to read book about Goggins\u0026rsquo;s ability to overcome the challenges laid out in front of them. It\u0026rsquo;ll make you want to push yourself much, much harder. Biography\n[250]Financial Intelligence by Karen Berman and Joe Knight (7/10) A useful overview of how to read and interpret financial statements for non-accounting people, great for helping you know what to do with your money as an early stage founder. Finance\n[251]Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller (7/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller Marketing\n[252]The Great CEO Within by Matt Mochary (7/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book The Great CEO Within by Matt Mochary. Management\n[253]Deep Work by Cal Newport (6/10) Learn how to focus intensely on your work to get more done in less time with this book from Cal Newport. Productivity\n[254]So Good They Can\u0026rsquo;t Ignore You by Cal Newport (6/10) Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;follow your passion,\u0026rdquo; focus on getting really good at something and passion will follow. This summarizes the entire book, without offering as much tactical advice as Deep Work (to me). Many people think this is his better book though, so try it for yourself. Entrepreneurship\n[255]Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin (6/10) While I think the ideas are compelling, and agree that leaders should take responsibility for their teams, there were plenty of cases in the book where the opposite of the concept could have been an equally valid argument. Leadership\n[256]The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz (6/10) This is an excellent book for someone who is new to cognitive biases and heuristics and who wants to improve their decision making. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get much out of it since I already knew a lot of it, but if you\u0026rsquo;re just getting into the topic it\u0026rsquo;s a good place to start. Decision Making\n[257]Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim (6/10) Mental model: create blue oceans, don\u0026rsquo;t fight in the \u0026ldquo;Red oceans.\u0026rdquo; The figures are useful for determining how to find your blue ocean strategies. Marketing\n[258]Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero by James Romm (6/10) An interesting story about the life of Seneca, though it made me realize that I care much more about his ideas than him as a person. Biography\n[259]The Price of Privilege by Madeline Levine (6/10) The first 1/3 is a great primer on the problems of popular parents styles and how that leads to depression, angst, and the excellent sheep problems. The rest is how to parent better, which I (obviously) did not find quite as useful (but if you\u0026rsquo;re a parent, read it!!!) College\n[260]The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson (6/10) Some good ideas, but I would suggest an old philosophy book instead. If you enjoy his blog you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy the book, but to others, the writing style might seem unnecessarily coarse. Philosophy\n[261]Worldly Wisdom: Quotations and Aphorisms by Josh Kaufman (6/10) An assorted collection of quotations and aphorisms on various subjects. Unrated since it didn\u0026rsquo;t really introduce anything, just curate them. Good for a skim through to find interesting ideas and thinkers. Aphorisms\n[262]The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley (6/10) It\u0026rsquo;s just okay. There are some interesting stats on global prosperity, but it was kind of hard to get through at parts and felt overly optimistic in others. I\u0026rsquo;d rather read a more balanced perspective on the subject. History\n[263]Discipline \u0026amp; Punish: The Birth of the Prison by Michael Foucault (6/10) Confusing\u0026hellip; and one of the harder books I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I recommend it, but it\u0026rsquo;s good. Definitely gave me a much better understanding of postmodernist thought than by just going off of how it\u0026rsquo;s described in the popular media. Philosophy\n[264]The Jungle by Upton Sinclair (6/10) More about capitalism than the meat packing industry, it\u0026rsquo;s an entertaining book, but fails to make a compelling case for socialism. Fiction\n[265]What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Jim Paul (6/10) A more story-focused version of many of the lessons in Fooled by Randomness. If you understood that book, you won\u0026rsquo;t need this one. Finance\n[266]Street Photography: Capture the Life of Your City (6/10) The heuristics for good street photos are great, but all of the editing is done with VSCO filters which was kind of annoying. Wanted to learn more about doing the editing myself. Photography\n[267]Remote by Jason Fried (6/10) A light read on the benefits of remote work. Some bias since the authors work in a leading remote company\u0026hellip; Management\n[268]Daily Rituals by Mason Currey (6/10) A little dull just reading through summaries of everyone\u0026rsquo;s routines, but it was cool to see how different famous people whose work I like worked. Lots of drugs, alcohol, bad habits, but also strong routines and rituals. Productivity\n[269]Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes (6/10) Interesting, tough to get through at parts. It\u0026rsquo;s very \u0026ldquo;this happened, then this happened, then this happened\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Disturbing to see how few people could have such a large negative impact on the public understanding of science and health, though. Science\n[270]I Used to Be a Human Being by Andrew Sullivan (6/10) Technology has made us inhuman, this piece argues. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how compelling it is since most of these habits are just deeper human desires manifest in new technology, but it\u0026rsquo;s an interesting argument nonetheless. Technology\n[271]Long-Distance Real Estate Investing by David Greene (6/10) My notes and takeaways from David Greene\u0026rsquo;s book on how to invest in real estate in different cities from here you live. Real Estate\n[272]Happy Accidents by Morton A Meyers (6/10) An interesting overview of the role of serendipity in scientific and medical breakthroughs. It got a little dry at times, though, and somewhat repetitive. Still an interesting medical and scientific history though. Science\n[273]Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by Neil Degrasse Tyson (6/10) An entertaining read on science and astrophysics, but ultimately it felt a little shallow compared to books like A Brief History of Time. Science\n[274]Getting Everything You Can Out of All You\u0026rsquo;ve Got (6/10) A decent book on getting more clients for your services business. You can probably just read the summary, lots of repetition. Sales\n[275]Smoke Signals by Martin A. Lee (6/10) An interesting history on the medical and legal history of weed in the US. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how bad the misinformation around it has been, or how much money and energy has been wasted in fighting its spread. Lower rating is just because it gets a little slow at times and it\u0026rsquo;s LONG. History\n[276]Unconventional Medicine by Chris Kresser (6/10) A good introduction to functional medicine, and the many issues plaguing the medical, insurance, and health world of today. Health\n[277]The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal (5/10) A good book on willpower, but I no longer recommend it since it seems like most of the research in it hasn\u0026rsquo;t held up. Productivity\n[278]The Inevitable by Kevin Kelly (5/10) An interesting collection of thoughts on where the future might be headed, but I found myself bored during it. It just feels like Kevin rambling over a couple drinks about what might happen. That said, if you\u0026rsquo;re in the tech startup space (or want to be), this will probably give you a lot of ideas. Technology\n[279]The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande (5/10) Checklists are good for making sure things get done, even in complex fields like medicine. Make more of them. (That\u0026rsquo;s most of the book). Productivity\n[280]Bold by Peter Diamandis (5/10) The first 2/3 of the book is an excellent primer on being bold as fuck, then the last third is a confusingly placed foray into crowdfunding (??). The first 2/3 are great though if you want to start thinking bigger with your goals. Entrepreneurship\n[281]Essentialism by Greg McKeown (5/10) I didn\u0026rsquo;t get much from this book, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of in-between Paradox of Choice and some of the psychology of 4-Hour Workweek, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t do as good a job\u0026hellip; Mindfulness \u0026amp; Meditation\n[282]Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday (5/10) Better than Obstacle, it has some useful advice and good stories about how ego can lead to your downfall. It\u0026rsquo;s a tangent to stoic philosophy, so if you enjoy those concepts you\u0026rsquo;ll probably get something from this book. Philosophy\n[283]Million Dollar Consulting by Alan Weiss (5/10) It\u0026rsquo;s okay, not sure why it\u0026rsquo;s so popular. Most of it felt fairly intuitive. The outline for creating a good proposal was great, though, and easy to incorporate into my own work. Entrepreneurship\n[284]Profit First by Mike Michalowitz (5/10) A condensed summary of the Profit First method and what to take away from the book, whether you\u0026rsquo;ve already read it or are thinking of reading it. Entrepreneurship\n[285]The Lean Startup by Eric Reis (4/10) I think there are better books out there for introducing you to these ideas, even though this is \u0026ldquo;the book\u0026rdquo; on them. Surprisingly light in useful detail. Entrepreneurship\n[286]Growth Hacker Marketing by Ryan Holiday (4/10) Some interesting ideas, but read Immutable Laws instead. Marketing\n[287]How We Learn by Benedict Carey (4/10) I didn\u0026rsquo;t get much from this one, I think some people like it, but I felt there was a lot of bias and bad research. I\u0026rsquo;d read other books on learning. Learning\n[288]The Education of Millionaires by Michael Ellsberg (4/10) I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel there was much here, he\u0026rsquo;s mostly commenting on other books and giving a textbook demonstration of narrative fallacy and confirmation bias. College\n[289]Unshakeable by Tony Robbins (4/10) It\u0026rsquo;s essentially a spark-notes for \u0026ldquo;Money Master the Game,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;d recommend reading the full book instead since it\u0026rsquo;s much more thorough and worth the time investment. Finance\n[290]The Art of Non-Conformity by Chris Guillebeau (4/10) It\u0026rsquo;s a good quick read on principles of thinking for yourself in today\u0026rsquo;s economy. Worth reading through if you like Chris\u0026rsquo;s blog, or if you\u0026rsquo;re a student trying to get out of the typical school / career path. Entrepreneurship\n[291]The First 20 Hours by Josh Kaufman (3/10) This is basically a much worse version of 4-Hour Chef. Kaufman doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring nearly as much to the table as Ferriss, and it feels a little rushed and under researched. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to quickly develop skills, I\u0026rsquo;d read 4-Hour Chef instead. Learning\n[292]Fluent in 3 Months by Benny Lewis (3/10) Speak the language from day one, use visualizations to remember words. The rest of the book is mostly fluff on those two concepts\u0026hellip; Language\n[293]Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott (3/10) I didn\u0026rsquo;t get much from this one, not sure why there\u0026rsquo;s so much hype around it. I don\u0026rsquo;t write much fiction, though\u0026hellip; Writing\n[294]Choose Yourself by James Altucher (3/10) I found this book very hard to take seriously. Too much pumping you up rah rah you can do it, not enough substance. I think that\u0026rsquo;s what his audience wants, though. Entrepreneurship\n[295]Psych by Judd Biasiotto (3/10) Some interesting thoughts on peak performance, but a bit too woo-woo without enough to back it up. Takeaway: meditation is good for performance. Fitness\n[296]The Power of No by James Altucher (3/10) Say No to more things, even if it hurts. Think Hell Yeah or No. Got it? Good. Saved you a few dollars and hours. Decision Making\n[297]Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss (3/10) I was disappointed. I love Tim\u0026rsquo;s work, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t deliver in the way his past books have. There\u0026rsquo;s zero thematic organization, so you can\u0026rsquo;t reference certain topics you want to learn more about except in a few cases. Learning\n[298]The 12 Week Year by Brian Moran (3/10) It\u0026rsquo;s okay, didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like there was anything groundbreaking here in the planning, productivity, or business space though. Productivity\n[299]Escape from Cubicle Nation by Pamela Slim (3/10) A few useful ideas, but felt like it was reiterating a lot of entrepreneurship stuff you\u0026rsquo;ll see in other books. Read 4HWW and Millionaire Fastlane instead. Entrepreneurship\n[300]Perennial Seller by Ryan Holiday (3/10) I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this will be a perennial bestseller. Fairly shallow marketing and writing advice, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend reading something else. Marketing\n[301]Traction: Get A Grip On Your Business by Gino Wickman (3/10) The most important highlights and takeaways from the book Traction: Get A Grip On Your Business by Gino Wickman Business\n[302]This Book Will Teach You How to Write Better (2/10) Borrows heavily from other copywriting books without attribution. I\u0026rsquo;d strongly recommend reading Boron Letters instead. Copywriting\n[303]Black Hole Focus by Isaiah Hankel (2/10) Nothing new, just rehashes. Productivity\n[304]The Fighter\u0026rsquo;s Mind by Sam Sheridan (2/10) Found this hard to read, and got little from it. There are some nice quotations, though. Fitness\n[305]Brain Rules by John Medina (2/10) Really didn\u0026rsquo;t find much new value here. Health\n[306]Manage Your Day-to-Day by Jocelyn Glei (2/10) Basically a bunch of guest posts rolled into a book. I\u0026rsquo;d look elsewhere. Productivity\n[307]The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield (2/10) It\u0026rsquo;s kinda like if The Secret was a novel, I wonder how many people read this and believe it\u0026rsquo;s real\u0026hellip; Fiction\n[308]Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy (1/10) Rehash on other productivity information, skip. Productivity\n[309]You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero (1/10) Don\u0026rsquo;t read it, she starts off with a bit of interesting material then gets into aligning your energy with the universe and anyone who respects reality has to stop at that point.

However since I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to troubleshoot these technologies in the past I was quite concerned of what would happen when I would have problems. Today my main computer didn\u0026rsquo;t boot up and I had to fix it manually. This post shows the steps I performed to recover my system.\nI use Arch Linux and I prepared a repository with my custom install method based on archinstaller. Basically I have a custom partitioning based on LVM on top of LUKS and some variables to start he installing method.\nHere is an overview of the parts on this tutorial:\nTutorial overview Create a bootable USB and boot the broken system with it (AKA recovery mode** Chroot into the system Fix the issue Assumptions I will assume that the error is similar as mine. After opening the LUKS device, I had the following problem: ERROR: device /dev/mapper/storage-root not found.\nCreate a bootable USB To create a bootable USB you need to download the latest Arch Linux iso and then us dd to dump it to a flash drive.\ndd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sync After completion, use the same flash drive to boot the broken computer. You generally need to hit a key on the F5 - F6 range to choose the boot method.\nChroot into the system Once the system has booted, now we need to mount everything the system would mount on a boot stage. Adapt the LUKS label and LVM devices according to your needs.\n# Open the LUKS device. cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/disk/by-partlabel/cryptlvm lvm # Mount the root partition mount /dev/storage/root /mnt # Mount the boot partition mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot # Mount proc, sys and dev mount -t proc proc proc/ mount -t sysfs sys sys/ mount -o bind /dev dev/ # Switch to bash bash # Chroot chroot /mnt # Bring up network if needed dhcpcd eth0 At this point you should have shell with a recovery environment set to fix the issue, so let\u0026rsquo;s fix it.\nFix the issue To fix the issue we basically are going to perform an upgrade an recreate the initial ramdisk\n# Update the packages database pacman -Syy # Upgrade the packages pacman -Syu # Update udev package pacman -S udev # Update mkinitcpio package pacman -S mkinitcpio # Recreate the initial ramdisk mkinitcpio -p linux # Exit the chroot environment exit # Reboot reboot If everything went well, you now should be able to boot the system properly.\nConclusions I was quite worried about how to solve this issue due to the several layers of complexity: GPT, LUKS and LVM, however everything went out quite smoothly. The key part is to use a USB flash drive and then mount the boot and root partitions to recreate the ramdisk.\nThanks for reading.

One nice way to do so is by using the Public Key Association (PKA) DNS record. Basically this is a record that points to a file that can be downloaded over the internet. This method is an alternative (not exclusive) to using keyservers.\nOne of the problems of keyservers (in my opinion), is the problem of deleting old keys. I pretty much like the idea of PGP keyserver which verifies periodically by sending an email if the address is still in use and therefore maintain that uid of the key. The only problem is that the PGP server is centralized and it does not use FLOSS standards.\nI understand that deleting a key on a distributed environment is hard and probably maintaining a history of deletions as done actually on most of keyservers is still a good solution. However since I don\u0026rsquo;t use GPG very often and I am not publishing my key yet, I wanted to try PKA.\nThis tutorial is made of two basic parts, first creating a TXT DNS record and then verifying that the key gets downloaded properly.\nTutorial overview Creating the TXT DNS record Testing the PKA record Assumptions I assume that you have gpg installed and that you know the basic idea on how it works, that you know what a private and a public keys are for and how to use them.\nCreating the TXT DNS record To create the TXT DNS record you will need to know the fingerprint of the key. To do so:\n$ gpg --list-keys vonpupp@keybase.io pub rsa2048/0x536814BF4871A220 2016-11-12 [SC] [expires: 2018-11-12] Key fingerprint = F0B9 B3FB 25E9 1209 728E 4844 5368 14BF 4871 A220 uid [ultimate] Albert De La Fuente \u0026lt;vonpupp@keybase.io\u0026gt; uid [ultimate] Albert De La Fuente (Social email address) \u0026lt;vonpupp@gmail.com\u0026gt; uid [ultimate] Albert De La Fuente (Main email address) \u0026lt;mail@albertdelafuente.com\u0026gt; uid [ultimate] Albert De La Fuente (Haevas email address) \u0026lt;albert@haevas.com\u0026gt; uid [ultimate] Albert De La Fuente (Academic email address) \u0026lt;albert@ime.usp.br\u0026gt; sub rsa2048/0xE2977BF3F82AB971 2016-11-12 [E] [expires: 2018-11-12] In my case, the fingerprint is F0B9 B3FB 25E9 1209 728E 4844 5368 14BF 4871 A220, or 0x536814BF4871A220 for short.\nThen you need to export the key with:\n$ gpg --export -a 0x536814BF4871A220 \u0026gt; public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc Then create a TXT record where:\nThe Name part: Is composed of mailbox._pka.albertdelafuente.com. So for instance if my email is long-anti-spam-email-address@albertdelafuentedotcom, then the name part should be long-anti-spam-email-address._pka.albertdelafuente.com.\nThe Text data: Contains the fingerprint and the URL where to download the key. In my case:\n\u0026#34;v=pka1;fpr=F0B9B3FB25E91209728E4844536814BF4871A220;uri=http://albertdelafuente.com/media/files/public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc\u0026#34; Do not forget to upload the key to match the uri as on the TXT record. In my case: http://albertdelafuente.com/media/files/public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc\nTesting the PKA record Once done that you can download the key (just for testing purposes) on another computer or VM as follows:\n$ echo \u0026#34;Test message\u0026#34; | gpg --auto-key-locate pka -ear mail@albertdelafuente.com In my case this will prompt you with a confirmation since my primary uid does not match the email. This is made in purpose because I have read that some spammers are using keyservers to get valid email addresses, therefore I always use keybase as my primary id.\nYou will see something similar to this as the output:\ngpg: directory =/home/vagrant/.gnupg\u0026#39; created gpg: new configuration file =/home/vagrant/.gnupg/gpg.conf\u0026#39; created gpg: WARNING: options in =/home/vagrant/.gnupg/gpg.conf\u0026#39; are not yet active during this run gpg: keyring =/home/vagrant/.gnupg/secring.gpg\u0026#39; created gpg: keyring =/home/vagrant/.gnupg/pubring.gpg\u0026#39; created gpg: requesting key 4871A220 from http server albertdelafuente.com gpg: /home/vagrant/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created gpg: key 4871A220: public key \u0026#34;Albert De La Fuente \u0026lt;vonpupp@keybase.io\u0026gt;\u0026#34; imported gpg: Total number processed: 1 gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1) gpg: automatically retrieved =mail@albertdelafuente.com\u0026#39; via PKA gpg: F82AB971: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user pub 2048R/F82AB971 2016-11-12 Albert De La Fuente \u0026lt;vonpupp@keybase.io\u0026gt; Primary key fingerprint: F0B9 B3FB 25E9 1209 728E 4844 5368 14BF 4871 A220 Subkey fingerprint: 7A10 07B4 3F49 5317 5DE0 52E8 E297 7BF3 F82A B971 It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user ID.

On a network of several Arch Linux boxes, it is possible to configure a Master server which will hold a copy of all the installed packages within that host and keep it up to date frequently. The other hosts on the network can be configured as Slaves and they will download the packages from the Master whenever possible instead of the Internet directly. The objective is to save bandwidth and time when using the package manager.\nConfiguring Pacserve and Powerpill on Arch Linux The documentation of Pacserve explains how it works. This image summarizes well the behavior.\nPacserve by itself seems very interesting however I could not make it work properly. I think it has something to do my router UDP multicast forwarding support (see openwrt-multicast). Nevertheless, I could use it within Powerpill which is a pacman wrapper to allow parallel and segmented downloads through Aria2 and Reflector. This combo sounds even better, so I will focus on how to install and use the tree tools together.\nInstallation # Just in case the testdb does not exists gpg --list-key # Receive xyne gpg key gpg --recv-keys 1D1F0DC78F173680 # Install the packages yaourt -Sy --noconfirm reflector pacserve powerpill Starting the services (both the Master and Slave(s) host(s)) After everything is installed:\n# Enable opening the ports sudo systemctl enable pacserve-ports.service # Enable pacserve sudo systemctl enable pacserve.service # Start pacserve sudo systemctl start pacserve.service For troubleshooting purposes the services can be started manually.

Troubleshooting Pacserve (without Powerpill) As I said before I could not make it working using multicast, so I had to manually start the Pacserve Master host as:\nInput:\npacserve --multicast Output:\nPacserveServer PID 1048 Addresses lo: 127.0.0.1 eth0: 10.0.2.15 enp0s9: 192.168.56.6 Port 15678 Multicast Address all interfaces Multicast Port 15679 Multicast Group 224.3.45.67 Multicast Interval 5m Multicast Interfaces all Filelist None Filterlist None MOTD None Upload Directory None Paths None Static Peers None Press ctrl+C to exit.

Of course I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that manually, so I made a hack to do that automatically. Recently I had a new task to accomplish, to split into groups that use case list by their relationships, and once again I thought about doing it automatically since I already have the data structures available and then, I decided: let\u0026rsquo;s play a little bit with the data 8-).\nSince I\u0026rsquo;m not very familiarized with the use case data itself I looked up for a way on how to apply for the same concepts on other areas, and then I came up making some experiments with my Facebook and LinkedIn networks. I learned many things and the results were really interesting.\nI first started with my Facebook contacts and this was the initial result\nAfterward I applied a community detection algorithm (Louvain) with a specific parameter and I could identify 63 groups / communities.\nCan you see them? Well\u0026hellip; neither do I\u0026hellip; So I applied a atlas layout algorithm so it\u0026rsquo;s visually friendly, and this is the result\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting to notice that about 46% of my contacts are within the three biggest groups (20.77%, 14.46% and 12.52%). There are also contacts (that multicolored group in the middle) that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t retrieve their connections (probably because a privacy setting). Of course the graphics generated are anonymized, but I\u0026rsquo;m able to identify each group, for instance the bottom middle blue group are my last job work European colleagues. The top right cyan group are some friends from FLOSS communities. Pretty cool, huh?\nOn the other hand getting the Linkedin results wasn\u0026rsquo;t that straightforward I had to deal with oauth and the LinkedIn API webservice directly within python. This are the results of my LinkedIn network.\nSome notable groups at first were: bottom left cyan group are again my last work European colleagues, and green my last work Latin America colleagues.\nConclusions This is an amazingly powerful analytics tool that could be used in many areas, probably the most notable (nowadays) are marketing and social networking. At the same time it\u0026rsquo;s quite scary to see how our privacy goes away, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would be hard to track somebody having the right information. If I could do this by just examining the relationships imagine what could be possible with some extra data.\n","permalink":"https://albertdelafuente.com/posts/20220109211521-finding_communities_on_graphs/","tags":["graphs","communities","clustering"],"title":"Finding communities on graphs"},{"categories":["development"],"contents":"Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been to a talk given by Richard Stallman about how software patents are useless for the software industry. Since software is applied mathematics and, it generally needs to combine several ideas to make a new one, by doing that you could easily infringe a software patent by using one (or more) of the patented ideas.\nHe commented that patents are like walking in a mine field, but worst because a mine ones it blows up it doesn\u0026rsquo;t blows again, patents keeps blowing on and on. He later highlighted some different scenarios.\nA patent for your idea not to be \u0026ldquo;stolen\u0026rdquo;**. This is the worst case scenario You might think that you had a great idea and you want to patent it so no one will stole your idea. Later a big company comes in and develops something around your idea. Then something similar will happen\u0026hellip;\n\u0026gt; (You) You go there and say: Hey this idea is mine, and I have the patent so you cannot use it!\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; (Big company) Ohh, it is a shame\u0026hellip; But let me remind you that within your idea you used some ideas similar to these three patents of us\u0026hellip;\n\u0026gt; (oh oh)\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;and we can find other patents (among our thousands) of us, you might violated with your idea as well\u0026hellip;\n\u0026gt; ehmmm\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;so in order to no one get hurts, lets make a deal: You give us the right to use your patent and we wont sue you\n\u0026gt; Well\u0026hellip; You evaluate (in silence) and remember that they have some good lawyers and a lot of money as well\u0026hellip; And you end by saying: Okay you can use it\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Great. Thanks =D\nConclusion: The big company wins.\nA patent to protect yourself from others attacking you The truth is that it won\u0026rsquo;t protect you unless you find another infringement on the other side that is covered by your patent. A minor company wont sue you anyway since they don\u0026rsquo;t have the resources, and a big one will have very good lawyers to do so and to also defend themselves, so it\u0026rsquo;s a endless legal battle and unnecessary waste of money.\nHe also pointed that in fact a patent could be also be harmful if you try to defend yourself you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use it properly, or something is wrong within the patent.\nConclusion A never ending legal story if someones attacks you, or in the best scenario nobody will attack you so you won\u0026rsquo;t really need the patent in first place.\nLater he also made a symbolism about software and music which personally I found very interesting. \u0026ldquo;Imagine that when Beethoven was alive the whole patent idea arose and somebody patented parts of musical pieces. Then some beautiful compositions would never been made. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to compose for the beauty of doing so than composing with the worry of not getting sued\u0026rdquo;.\nThe whole speech makes a lot of sense while patents in software don\u0026rsquo;t.\n","permalink":"https://albertdelafuente.com/posts/20220109211322-software_patents/","tags":["software","floss","patents"],"title":"Software patents"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Results from static site search implemented using Fusejs, jquery and mark.js. \u0026ndash; Source\n","permalink":"https://albertdelafuente.com/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search"}]
