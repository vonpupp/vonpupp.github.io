This original idea came from an analysis I did on my social networks out of curiosity and I could identify and find communities on graphs.\nNow I am using org-roam as my notes management app.","type":"entry","url":"https://albertdelafuente.com/posts/20220612002812-exploring_my_exo_brain/"},{"content":{"html":"\u003cdiv class=\"ox-hugo-toc toc\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"heading\"\u003eTable of Contents\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how\"\u003eHow?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#assumptions-and-limitations\"\u003eAssumptions and limitations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#interesting-findings\"\u003eInteresting findings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#experiments-organized-by-sections\"\u003eExperiments organized by sections\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#experiments-organized-by-books\"\u003eExperiments organized by books\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c!--endtoc--\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other day I was thinking about some practical way of learning hebrew,\nsomething dynamic that tickles my scientist curiosity. And I thought, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nit be cool if I could parse one of the hebrew codexes and get the top 20 most\nfrequent words of a chapter or a book?

I thought about parsing a mysword module, which are in reality a sqlite\ndatabase so that should be easy\u0026hellip; but then when I was doing something totally\nunrelated (probably around the bees or my first batch of mead) it hit me\u0026hellip; I\nhave several bibles from the Sword project already installed on my notebook and\nis all OSS, so\u0026hellip; there is probably a python wrapper around diatheke or\nsimilar\u0026hellip; and sure it is =)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want the technicalities, go read my note on \u003ca href=\"/exobrain/20220601221125-how_to_parse_the_aleppo_codex_and_analyze_its_content_in_python/\"\u003eHow to parse the Aleppo codex\nand analyze its content in python\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you are not a geekie human, you probably are interested only in the\nresults rather than the bits and bytes.

Per book? Per \u0026ldquo;stories\u0026rdquo;? Or even other\nslicing like Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim.

This brings\na ton of challenges. For the sake of simplicity I had to stick to a codex that\ndoes not include niqqud whatsoever. I am not sure if this is a good approach or\nnot because two different words without niqqud can render the same writing yet\nhave totally different meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is that there are words that are trivially known like לא (h2834)\nor אל (h3882); or words that are not translated yet used very much like את\n(h7073). I have implemented a filter to have the possibility to skip these\nwords. Not because they are not relevant, the Aleph-Tav has a ton of secrets and\nimportance. But there are mixed together some irrelevant tokens considered as\nwords, like opening and closing brackets and parenthesis or similar. So I\nimplemented a list to ignore these words that are rather known or really\nirrelevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"interesting-findings\"\u003eInteresting findings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was rather interesting to me how fast the repetitions decline on unfiltered\nwords.

Assumptions and limitations Interesting findings Experiments organized by sections Experiments organized by books Conclusion The other day I was thinking about some practical way of learning hebrew, something dynamic that tickles my scientist curiosity. And I thought, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be cool if I could parse one of the hebrew codexes and get the top 20 most frequent words of a chapter or a book? Well this is an attempt to answer these type of questions.\nHow? So I rolled my sleeves and I thought: I will google the Aleppo codex in plain text so I can download it and later use it for analysis. The problem is, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it\u0026hellip;\nThe next challenge then is, how can I produce a plain text version of the Aleppo codex? I thought about parsing a mysword module, which are in reality a sqlite database so that should be easy\u0026hellip; but then when I was doing something totally unrelated (probably around the bees or my first batch of mead) it hit me\u0026hellip; I have several bibles from the Sword project already installed on my notebook and is all OSS, so\u0026hellip; there is probably a python wrapper around diatheke or similar\u0026hellip; and sure it is =)\nIf you want the technicalities, go read my note on How to parse the Aleppo codex and analyze its content in python.\nBut if you are not a geekie human, you probably are interested only in the results rather than the bits and bytes. This is why I splitted the whole thing in two notes, one more IT related and one more Hebrew related. So here we go, brace yourselves this is probably going to be long.\nI am not sure on how to \u0026ldquo;slice\u0026rdquo; the codex so the chunks makes sense for an analysis, for instance: per chapter? Per book? Per \u0026ldquo;stories\u0026rdquo;? Or even other slicing like Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim. Since it is not clear I will start slicing by books at first.\nAssumptions and limitations Hebrew has some peculiarities one of them being the vowel pointing. This brings a ton of challenges. For the sake of simplicity I had to stick to a codex that does not include niqqud whatsoever. I am not sure if this is a good approach or not because two different words without niqqud can render the same writing yet have totally different meaning.\nAnother problem is that there are words that are trivially known like לא (h2834) or אל (h3882); or words that are not translated yet used very much like את (h7073). I have implemented a filter to have the possibility to skip these words. Not because they are not relevant, the Aleph-Tav has a ton of secrets and importance. But there are mixed together some irrelevant tokens considered as words, like opening and closing brackets and parenthesis or similar. So I implemented a list to ignore these words that are rather known or really irrelevant.\nInteresting findings It was rather interesting to me how fast the repetitions decline on unfiltered words. For instance the most used word is the את (h854) with 7073 occurrences. Yet 30 words later in a row, there is a 90% decline in occurrences, משה (h) with 704 occurrences.\nExperiments organized by sections Full Tanakh - top 20 words - unfiltered Word Count Strong את 7073 h854 יהוה 5611 h3068 אשר 4629 h834 אל 3882 h410 כי 3553 h3588 על 3140 h5921 לא 2834 h3809 כל 2757 h5921 ואת 2190 h854 ישראל 2085 h3479 ויאמר 2043 h559 Related בני 1650 h1123 בן 1607 h1121 ולא 1447 h3809 Related Full Tanakh - Top 50 words - unfiltered The words from above as the top 20, plus the following words\nWord Count Strong לו 1045 h3863 איש 1027 h376 המלך 1014 h4428 בית 1003 h1004 מלך 1000 h4427 הוא 910 h1931 עד 904 h5704 לאמר 897 h559 / 564 לך 871 h הארץ 856 h776 ויהי 808 h אמר 797 h559 דבר 787 h1697 העם 724 h5971 Related וכל 712 h3606 Related משה 704 h4872 שם 681 h8043 מן 661 h4478 לי 660 h הזה 650 h1957 אני 635 h589 יהודה 632 h3063 לפני 615 h3942 להם 607 h3859 אם 607 h518 אלהים 597 h430 אדני 587 h136 דוד 583 h1730 אתה 582 h857 עם 582 h5973 Torah Word Count Strong את 2569 h אשר 1617 h יהוה 1493 h אל 1241 h על 949 h כל 921 h כי 895 h לא 861 h ואת 809 h בני 620 h ויאמר 619 h משה 598 h ישראל 508 h ס 491 h הוא 420 h הארץ 352 h ולא 345 h לו 330 h Experiments organized by books Genesis Word Count Strong את 658 h854 אשר 351 h834 ויאמר 337 h559 אל 335 h410 כי 263 h3588 ואת 205 h854 על 203 h5921 כל 199 h3605 אלהים 150 h430 יוסף 144 h3130 יעקב 142 h3290 יהוה 141 h3068 לא 137 h3809 הארץ 126 h776 לו 126 h3863 ויהי 125 h1961 בני 118 h1123 הוא 110 h1931 אברהם 108 h85 שנה 102 h8141 Conclusion The more I try to know, the less I feel I know\u0026hellip; This coding-linguistic area is fascinating and intreaguing. I feel like a taxonomy of this area is needed.\nThis will probaly take a lot of time, which I don\u0026rsquo;t have. So I want to try to balance between being effective and being efficient. I cannot afford to spend much time with this project but on the other hand the Hebrew language is really really apealing to me. I have yet to find a balance on how to proceed.\nAs part of documenting things I am going to include some very interesting resources that I have found.\nFrom the time I spent researching I would probably go with the BHSA DB. This is a proposed roadmap:\nCheck the ETCBC/course materials for an introduction Check the BHSA/bigTables for Pandas examples and learn how to use it Reevaluate then Also, if focus is more in learning Hebrew, check the Parabible website which looks really lean and straigthforward.\nBible in Hebrew Demo Source: https://www.bibleinhebrew.com/bih/BiH_demo.php?uid=10 Title: Bible in Hebrew Demo Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] See, Hear, and Read the Bible in Hebrew - BibleinHebrew.com Source: https://www.bibleinhebrew.com/bih/ Title: See, Hear, and Read the Bible in Hebrew - BibleinHebrew.com Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] Parabible | Genesis 1 Source: https://parabible.com/Genesis/1 Title: Parabible | Genesis 1 Captured on: [2022-06-06 Mon] GitHub - jcuenod/awesome-bible-data: 😎 A curated list of generously licensed Bible data.

One nice way to do so is by using the Public Key Association (PKA) DNS record. Basically this is a record that points to a file that can be downloaded over the internet. This method is an alternative (not exclusive) to using keyservers.\nOne of the problems of keyservers (in my opinion), is the problem of deleting old keys. I pretty much like the idea of PGP keyserver which verifies periodically by sending an email if the address is still in use and therefore maintain that uid of the key. The only problem is that the PGP server is centralized and it does not use FLOSS standards.\nI understand that deleting a key on a distributed environment is hard and probably maintaining a history of deletions as done actually on most of keyservers is still a good solution.

On a network of several Arch Linux boxes, it is possible to configure a Master server which will hold a copy of all the installed packages within that host and keep it up to date frequently. The other hosts on the network can be configured as Slaves and they will download the packages from the Master whenever possible instead of the Internet directly. The objective is to save bandwidth and time when using the package manager.\nConfiguring Pacserve and Powerpill on Arch Linux The documentation of Pacserve explains how it works. This image summarizes well the behavior.\nPacserve by itself seems very interesting however I could not make it work properly. I think it has something to do my router UDP multicast forwarding support (see openwrt-multicast). Nevertheless, I could use it within Powerpill which is a pacman wrapper to allow parallel and segmented downloads through Aria2 and Reflector. This combo sounds even better, so I will focus on how to install and use the tree tools together.\nInstallation # Just in case the testdb does not exists gpg --list-key # Receive xyne gpg key gpg --recv-keys 1D1F0DC78F173680 # Install the packages yaourt -Sy --noconfirm reflector pacserve powerpill Starting the services (both the Master and Slave(s) host(s)) After everything is installed:\n# Enable opening the ports sudo systemctl enable pacserve-ports.service # Enable pacserve sudo systemctl enable pacserve.service # Start pacserve sudo systemctl start pacserve.service For troubleshooting purposes the services can be started manually.
