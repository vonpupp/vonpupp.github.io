<p>*1* These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with
Jacob, each with his household: ^{2 }Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
^{3 }Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, ^{4 }Dan and Naphtali, Gad and
Asher. ^{5 }All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph
was already in Egypt. ^{6 }Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and
all that generation. ^{7 }But the people of Israel were fruitful and

the land was filled with them.</p>

<p>^{8 }Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
^{9 }And he said to his people, “Behold, the people of Israel are too
many and too mighty for us. ^{10 }Come, let us deal shrewdly with them,
lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and
fight against us and escape from the land.” ^{11 }Therefore they set
taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for
Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses. ^{12 }But the more they were
oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And
the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel. ^{13 }So they
ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves ^{14 }and made their
lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of
work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as
slaves.</p>
<p>^{15 }Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom
was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, ^{16 }“When you serve as midwife
to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you
shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” ^{17 }But the
midwives feared Elohim and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded
them, but let the male children live. ^{18 }So the king of Egypt called
the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and let the male
children live?” ^{19 }The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew
women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give
birth before the midwife comes to them.” ^{20 }So Elohim dealt well with
the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong. ^{21 }And
because the midwives feared Elohim, he gave them families. ^{22 }Then
Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born to the
Hebrews<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1555a">a</a>]</sup>
you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”</p>
<h4 id="the-birth-of-moses">The Birth of Moses&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash no-text-decoration" href="#the-birth-of-moses">#</a> </h4>
<p>*2* Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite
woman. ^{2 }The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he
was a fine child, she hid him three months. ^{3 }When she could hide him
no longer, she took for him a basket made of
bulrushes<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1558b">b</a>]</sup>
and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed
it among the reeds by the river bank. ^{4 }And his sister stood at a
distance to know what would be done to him. ^{5 }Now the daughter of
Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked
beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her
servant woman, and she took it. ^{6 }When she opened it, she saw the
child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said,
“This is one of the Hebrews&rsquo; children.” ^{7 }Then his sister said to
Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew
women to nurse the child for you?” ^{8 }And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to
her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child&rsquo;s mother. ^{9 }And
Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for
me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and
nursed him. ^{10 }When the child grew older, she brought him to
Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses,
“Because,” she said, “I drew him out of the
water.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1565c">c</a>]</sup></p>

<p>^{11 }One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and
looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of
his
people.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1566d">d</a>]</sup>
^{12 }He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the
Egyptian and hid him in the sand. ^{13 }When he went out the next day,
behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in
the wrong, “Why do you strike your companion?” ^{14 }He answered, “Who
made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you
killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “Surely the
thing is known.” ^{15 }When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill
Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And
he sat down by a well.</p>
<p>^{16 }Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and
drew water and filled the troughs to water their father&rsquo;s flock.
^{17 }The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and
saved them, and watered their flock. ^{18 }When they came home to their
father Reuel, he said, “How is it that you have come home so soon
today?” ^{19 }They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of
the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
^{20 }He said to his daughters, “Then where is he? Why have you left the
man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” ^{21 }And Moses was content to
dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah. ^{22 }She
gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, “I
have been a
sojourner<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1577e">e</a>]</sup>

<p>^{23 }During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of
Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their
cry for rescue from slavery came up to Elohim. ^{24 }And Elohim heard
their groaning, and Elohim remembered his covenant with Abraham, with
Isaac, and with Jacob. ^{25 }Elohim saw the people of
Israel&mdash;and Elohim knew.</p>
<h4 id="the-burning-bush">The Burning Bush&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash no-text-decoration" href="#the-burning-bush">#</a> </h4>
<p>*3* Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the
priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the
wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of Elohim. ^{2 }And the angel
of YHWH appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
^{3 }And Moses said, “I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the
bush is not burned.” ^{4 }When YHWH saw that he turned aside to
see, Elohim called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said,
“Here I am.” ^{5 }Then he said, “Do not come near; take your sandals off
your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”
^{6 }And he said, “I am the Elohim of your father, the Elohim of
Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob.” And Moses hid
his face, for he was afraid to look at Elohim.</p>
<p>^{7 }Then YHWH said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who
are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I
know their sufferings, ^{8 }and I have come down to deliver them out of
the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a
good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of
the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,
and the Jebusites. ^{9 }And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel
has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the
Egyptians oppress them. ^{10 }Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you
may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” ^{11 }But
Moses said to Elohim, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring
the children of Israel out of Egypt?” ^{12 }He said, “But I will be with
you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you
have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve Elohim on this
mountain.”</p>
<p>^{13 }Then Moses said to Elohim, “If I come to the people of Israel and
say to them, ‘The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you,&rsquo; and they
ask me, ‘What is his name?&rsquo; what shall I say to them?” ^{14 }Elohim said
to Moses, “I am who I
am.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1594f">f</a>]</sup>
And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I am has sent me to
you.&rsquo;” ^{15 }Elohim also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of
Israel,
‘YHWH,<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1595g">g</a>]</sup>
the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac,
and the Elohim of Jacob, has sent me to you.&rsquo; This is my name forever,
and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations. ^{16 }Go and
gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘YHWH, the Elohim
of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has
appeared to me, saying, “I have observed you and what has been done to
you in Egypt, ^{17 }and I promise that I will bring you up out of the
affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing
with milk and honey.”&rsquo; ^{18 }And they will listen to your voice, and you
and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him,
‘YHWH, the Elohim of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let
us go a three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice
to YHWH our Elohim.&rsquo; ^{19 }But I know that the king of Egypt will not
let you go unless compelled by a mighty
hand.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1599h">h</a>]</sup>
^{20 }So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the
wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go. ^{21 }And I
will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you
go, you shall not go empty, ^{22 }but each woman shall ask of her
neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold
jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your
daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.”</p>
<h4 id="moses-given-powerful-signs">Moses Given Powerful Signs&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash no-text-decoration" href="#moses-given-powerful-signs">#</a> </h4>
<p>*4* Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen
to my voice, for they will say, ‘YHWH did not appear to you.&rsquo;” ^{2 }YHWH
said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.” ^{3 }And
he said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it
became a serpent, and Moses ran from it. ^{4 }But YHWH said to Moses,
“Put out your hand and catch it by the tail”&mdash;so he put out his hand
and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand&mdash; ^{5 }“that they may
believe that YHWH, the Elohim of their fathers, the Elohim of Abraham,
the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
^{6 }Again, YHWH said to him, “Put your hand inside your
cloak.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1608i">i</a>]</sup>
And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold,
his hand was
leprous<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1608j">j</a>]</sup>
like snow. ^{7 }Then Elohim said, “Put your hand back inside your
cloak.” So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it
out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh. ^{8 }“If they
will not believe you,” Elohim said, “or listen to the first sign, they
may believe the latter sign. ^{9 }If they will not believe even these
two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the
Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take
from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”</p>
<p>^{10 }But Moses said to YHWH, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in
the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of
speech and of tongue.” ^{11 }Then YHWH said to him, “Who has made man&rsquo;s
mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I,
YHWH? ^{12 }Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach
you what you shall speak.” ^{13 }But he said, “Oh, my Lord, please send
someone else.” ^{14 }Then the anger of YHWH was kindled against Moses
and he said, “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that
he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he
sees you, he will be glad in his heart. ^{15 }You shall speak to him and
put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his
mouth and will teach you both what to do. ^{16 }He shall speak for you
to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as Elohim to
him. ^{17 }And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the
signs.”</p>

<p>^{18 }Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him,
“Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are
still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” ^{19 }And YHWH
said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were
seeking your life are dead.” ^{20 }So Moses took his wife and his sons
and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And
Moses took the staff of Elohim in his hand.</p>
<p>^{21 }And YHWH said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you
do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I
will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. ^{22 }Then
you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says YHWH, Israel is my firstborn son,
^{23 }and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me.” If you
refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.&rsquo;”</p>
<p>^{24 }At a lodging place on the way YHWH met him and sought to put him
to death. ^{25 }Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son&rsquo;s
foreskin and touched

feet with it and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!”
^{26 }So he let him alone. It was then that she said, “A bridegroom of
blood,” because of the circumcision.</p>
<p>^{27 }YHWH said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he
went and met him at the mountain of Elohim and kissed him. ^{28 }And
Moses told Aaron all the words of YHWH with which he had sent him to
speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do. ^{29 }Then
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people
of Israel. ^{30 }Aaron spoke all the words that YHWH had spoken to Moses
and did the signs in the sight of the people. ^{31 }And the people
believed; and when they heard that YHWH had visited the people of Israel
and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and
worshiped.</p>
<h4 id="making-bricks-without-straw">Making Bricks Without Straw&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash no-text-decoration" href="#making-bricks-without-straw">#</a> </h4>
<p>*5* Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says YHWH,
the Elohim of Israel, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to
me in the wilderness.&rsquo;” ^{2 }But Pharaoh said, “Who is YHWH, that I
should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know YHWH, and
moreover, I will not let Israel go.” ^{3 }Then they said, “The Elohim of
the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days&rsquo; journey into
the wilderness that we may sacrifice to YHWH our Elohim, lest he fall
upon us with pestilence or with the sword.” ^{4 }But the king of Egypt
said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from
their work? Get back to your burdens.” ^{5 }And Pharaoh said, “Behold,
the people of the land are now
many,<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A1+-+6%3A1&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1638l">l</a>]</sup>
and you make them rest from their burdens!” ^{6 }The same day Pharaoh
commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, ^{7 }“You
shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past;
let them go and gather straw for themselves. ^{8 }But the number of
bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by
no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go
and offer sacrifice to our Elohim.&rsquo; ^{9 }Let heavier work be laid on the
men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”</p>
<p>^{10 }So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said
to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw. ^{11 }Go
and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work
will not be reduced in the least.&rsquo;” ^{12 }So the people were scattered
throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. ^{13 }The
taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, your daily task
each day, as when there was straw.” ^{14 }And the foremen of the people
of Israel, whom Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and
were asked, “Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today
and yesterday, as in the past?”</p>
<p>^{15 }Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to
Pharaoh, “Why do you treat your servants like this? ^{16 }No straw is
given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!&rsquo; And behold,
your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”
^{17 }But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say,
‘Let us go and sacrifice to YHWH.&rsquo; ^{18 }Go now and work. No straw will
be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.”
^{19 }The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble
when they said, “You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks,
your daily task each day.” ^{20 }They met Moses and Aaron, who were
waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; ^{21 }and they said to
them, “YHWH look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the
sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to
kill us.”</p>
<p>^{22 }Then Moses turned to YHWH and said, “O Lord, why have you done
evil to this people? Why did you ever send me? ^{23 }For since I came to
Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you
have not delivered your people at all.”</p>

to say, ‘Rise and walk&rsquo;? ^{24 }But that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins”&mdash;he said to the man who was
paralyzed&mdash;“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.”

<p>^{12 }And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why
do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own
power or piety we have made him walk? ^{13 }The Elohim of Abraham,
the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, the Elohim of our fathers,
glorified his
servant<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+3%3A12-15&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-26998a">a</a>]</sup>
Yeshua, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate,
when he had decided to release him. ^{14 }But you denied the Holy and
Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, ^{15 }and
you killed the Author of life, whom Elohim raised from the dead. To this
we are witnesses.</p>

<p>^{27 }And when they had brought them, they set them before the council.
And the high priest questioned them, ^{28 }saying, “We strictly charged
you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with
your teaching, and you intend to bring this man&rsquo;s blood upon us.”
^{29 }But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey Elohim rather
than men. ^{30 }The Elohim of our fathers raised Yeshua, whom you killed
by hanging him on a tree. ^{31 }Elohim exalted him at his right hand as
Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
^{32 }And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit,
whom Elohim has given to those who obey him.”</p>

<p>^{17 }“But as the time of the promise drew near, which Elohim had
granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt
^{18 }until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.
^{19 }He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose
their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. ^{20 }At this time
Moses was born; and he was beautiful in Elohim&rsquo;s sight. And he was
brought up for three months in his father&rsquo;s house, ^{21 }and when he was
exposed, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own
son. ^{22 }And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</p>
<p>^{23 }“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his
brothers, the children of Israel. ^{24 }And seeing one of them being
wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down
the Egyptian. ^{25 }He supposed that his brothers would understand
that Elohim was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not
understand. ^{26 }And on the following day he appeared to them as they
were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are
brothers. Why do you wrong each other?&rsquo; ^{27 }But the man who was
wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler
and a judge over us? ^{28 }Do you want to kill me as you killed the
Egyptian yesterday?&rsquo; ^{29 }At this retort Moses fled and became an exile
in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</p>
<p>^{30 }“Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the
wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. ^{31 }When
Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look,
there came the voice of the Lord: ^{32 }‘I am the Elohim of your
fathers, the Elohim of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.&rsquo; And Moses
trembled and did not dare to look. ^{33 }Then the Lord said to him,
‘Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are
standing is holy ground. ^{34 }I have surely seen the affliction of my
people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come
down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'</p>
<p>^{35 }“This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and
a judge?&rsquo;&mdash;this man Elohim sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand
of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. ^{36 }This man led them
out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the
wilderness for forty years.</p>

<p>^{12 }“And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken
of by all the Jews who lived there, ^{13 }came to me, and standing by me
said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.&rsquo; And at that very hour I
received my sight and saw him. ^{14 }And he said, ‘The Elohim of our
fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to
hear a voice from his mouth; ^{15 }for you will be a witness for him to
everyone of what you have seen and heard. ^{16 }And now why do you wait?

<p>^{14 }But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they
call a sect, I worship the Elohim of our fathers, believing everything
laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, ^{15 }having a hope in
Elohim, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a
resurrection of both the just and the unjust. ^{16 }So I always take
pains to have a clear conscience toward both Elohim and man.</p>

<p>^{23 }By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by
his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they
were not afraid of the king&rsquo;s edict. ^{24 }By faith Moses, when he was
grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter,
^{25 }choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of Elohim than to
enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. ^{26 }He considered the reproach
of HaMashiach greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was
looking to the reward.</p>

<p>12 In that day from the river Euphrates[e] to the Brook of Egypt YHWH will
thresh out the grain, and you will be gleaned one by one, O people of Israel. 13
And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the
land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and
worship YHWH on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p>
