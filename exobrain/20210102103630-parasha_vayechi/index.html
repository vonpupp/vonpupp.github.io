<p><sup class="versenum">28</sup>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days
of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.</p>

<p>^{29 }And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his
son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight,
put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with
me. Do not bury me in Egypt, ^{30 }but let me lie with my fathers. Carry
me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I
will do as you have said.” ^{31 }And he said, “Swear to me”; and he
swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his
bed.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1452a">a</a>]</sup></p>

<p><span class="chapternum"><strong>48</strong></span> After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.”
So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. ^{2 }And it was told to
Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and
sat up in bed. ^{3 }And Jacob said to Joseph, “Elohim Almighty<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1455b">b</a>]</sup> appeared to
me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, ^{4 }and said to me, ‘Behold, I
will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of
peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting
possession.&rsquo; ^{5 }And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of
Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be
mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. ^{6 }And the children that you fathered after
them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their
inheritance. ^{7 }As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died
in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1459c">c</a>]</sup> to go
to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”</p>

<p>^{8 }When Israel saw Joseph&rsquo;s sons, he said, “Who are these?”
^{9 }Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom Elohim has given
me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless
them.” ^{10 }Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could
not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and
embraced them. ^{11 }And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see
your face; and behold, Elohim has let me see your offspring also.”
^{12 }Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with
his face to the earth. ^{13 }And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his
right hand toward Israel&rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand
toward Israel&rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near him. ^{14 }And Israel
stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was
the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his
hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn). ^{15 }And he blessed Joseph and
said,</p>

<p>“The Elohim before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,<br />
    the Elohim who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,<br />
^{16 }the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys;<br />
    and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers
Abraham and Isaac;<br />

in the midst of the earth.”</p>

<p>^{17 }When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of
Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father&rsquo;s hand to move it
from Ephraim&rsquo;s head to Manasseh&rsquo;s head. ^{18 }And Joseph said to his
father, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put
your right hand on his head.” ^{19 }But his father refused and said, “I
know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall
be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he,
and his offspring shall become a
multitude<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1471e">e</a>]</sup>

<p>“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying,<br />
‘Elohim make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.&lsquo;”</p>

<p>Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. ^{21 }Then Israel said to Joseph,
“Behold, I am about to die, but Elohim will be with you and will bring
you again to the land of your fathers. ^{22 }Moreover, I have given to
you rather than to your brothers one mountain

<p>^{28 }All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their
father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing
suitable to him. ^{29 }Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to
be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
the field of Ephron the Hittite, ^{30 }in the cave that is in the field
at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying
place. ^{31 }There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they
buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah&mdash; ^{32 }the
field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.”
^{33 }When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into
the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.</p>

<p>*50* Then Joseph fell on his father&rsquo;s face and wept over him and kissed
him. ^{2 }And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. ^{3 }Forty days were required
for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the
Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</p>

<p>^{4 }And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the
household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes,
please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, ^{5 }‘My father made me
swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for
myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore,
let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.&lsquo;” ^{6 }And
Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
^{7 }So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the
servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of
the land of Egypt, ^{8 }as well as all the household of Joseph, his
brothers, and his father&rsquo;s household. Only their children, their flocks,
and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. ^{9 }And there went up
with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
^{10 }When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the
Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation,
and he made a mourning for his father seven days. ^{11 }When the
inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the
threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the
Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named
Abel-mizraim;<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1518p">p</a>]</sup>
it is beyond the Jordan. ^{12 }Thus his sons did for him as he had
commanded them, ^{13 }for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and
buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre,
which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess
as a burying place. ^{14 }After he had buried his father, Joseph
returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to
bury his father.</p>

“It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil
that we did to him.” ^{16 }So they sent a message to Joseph, saying,
“Your father gave this command before he died: ^{17 }‘Say to Joseph,
“Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin,
because they did evil to you.”&rsquo; And now, please forgive the
transgression of the servants of the Elohim of your father.” Joseph wept
when they spoke to him. ^{18 }His brothers also came and fell down
before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” ^{19 }But Joseph
said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of Elohim? ^{20 }As
for you, you meant evil against me, but Elohim meant it for good, to
bring it about that many
people<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1527q">q</a>]</sup>

kindly to them.</p>

generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted
as Joseph&rsquo;s
own.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+47%3A28+-+50%3A26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print#fen-ESV-1530r">r</a>]</sup>
^{24 }And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but Elohim
will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he
swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” ^{25 }Then Joseph made the
sons of Israel swear, saying, “Elohim will surely visit you, and you
shall carry up my bones from here.” ^{26 }So Joseph died, being 110
years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>

<p>^{31 }And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was
teaching them on the Sabbath, ^{32 }and they were astonished at his
teaching, for his word possessed authority. ^{33 }And in the synagogue
there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out
with a loud voice,
^{34 }“Ha!<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A31+-+5%3A11&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-25089a">a</a>]</sup>
What have you to do with us, Yeshua of Nazareth? Have you come to
destroy us? I know who you are&mdash;the Holy One of Elohim.”
^{35 }But Yeshua rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!”
And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of
him, having done him no harm. ^{36 }And they were all amazed and said to
one another, “What is this word? For with authority and power he
commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” ^{37 }And reports
about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</p>

<p>^{38 }And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon&rsquo;s house. Now
Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to
him on her behalf. ^{39 }And he stood over her and rebuked the fever,
and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.</p>

<p>^{40 }Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick
with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on
every one of them and healed them. ^{41 }And demons also came out of
many, crying, “You are the Son of Elohim!” But he rebuked them and would
not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was HaMashiach.</p>

<p>^{42 }And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place.
And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from
leaving them, ^{43 }but he said to them, “I must preach the good news of
the kingdom of Elohim to the other towns as well; for I was sent for
this purpose.” ^{44 }And he was preaching in the synagogues of
Judea.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A31+-+5%3A11&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-25099b">b</a>]</sup></p>

<p>*5* On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the
word of Elohim, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, ^{2 }and he
saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and
were washing their nets. ^{3 }Getting into one of the boats, which was
Simon&rsquo;s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down
and taught the people from the boat. ^{4 }And when he had finished
speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your
nets for a catch.” ^{5 }And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night
and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.” ^{6 }And
when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their
nets were breaking. ^{7 }They signaled to their partners in the other
boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so
that they began to sink. ^{8 }But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down
at Yeshua&rsquo; knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O
Lord.” ^{9 }For he and all who were with him were astonished at the
catch of fish that they had taken, ^{10 }and so also were James and
John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Yeshua said to
Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching
men.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A31+-+5%3A11&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-25109c">c</a>]</sup>
^{11 }And when they had brought their boats to land, they left
everything and followed him.</p>

According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a
living hope through the resurrection of Yeshua HaMashiach from the dead,

kept in heaven for you, ^{5 }who by Elohim&rsquo;s power are being guarded

you have been grieved by various trials, ^{7 }so that the tested
genuineness of your faith&mdash;more precious than gold that perishes though
it is tested by fire&mdash;may be found to result in praise and glory and
honor at the revelation of Yeshua HaMashiach. ^{8 }Though you have not
seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in
him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
^{9 }obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</p>
