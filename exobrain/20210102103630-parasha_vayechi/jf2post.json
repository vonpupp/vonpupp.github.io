Do not bury me in Egypt, ^{30 }but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.” ^{31 }And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.[a]\nJacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh 48 After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. ^{2 }And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed. ^{3 }And Jacob said to Joseph, “Elohim Almighty[b] appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, ^{4 }and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.\u0026rsquo; ^{5 }And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. ^{6 }And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. ^{7 }As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance[c] to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”\n^{8 }When Israel saw Joseph\u0026rsquo;s sons, he said, “Who are these?” ^{9 }Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom Elohim has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.” ^{10 }Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. ^{11 }And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face; and behold, Elohim has let me see your offspring also.” ^{12 }Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. ^{13 }And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel\u0026rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\u0026rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near him. ^{14 }And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn). ^{15 }And he blessed Joseph and said,\n“The Elohim before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,\nthe Elohim who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,\n^{16 }the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys;\nand in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;\nand let them grow into a multitude[d] in the midst of the earth.”\n^{17 }When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father\u0026rsquo;s hand to move it from Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s head to Manasseh\u0026rsquo;s head. ^{18 }And Joseph said to his father, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.” ^{19 }But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude[e] of nations.” ^{20 }So he blessed them that day, saying,\n“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying,\n‘Elohim make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.\u0026rsquo;”\nThus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. ^{21 }Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but Elohim will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. ^{22 }Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope[f] that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”\nJacob Blesses His Sons *49 *Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.\n^{2 }“Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob,\nlisten to Israel your father.\n^{3 }“Reuben, you are my firstborn,\nmy might, and the firstfruits of my strength,\npreeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.\n^{4 }Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence,\nbecause you went up to your father\u0026rsquo;s bed;\nthen you defiled it\u0026mdash;he went up to my couch!\n^{5 }“Simeon and Levi are brothers;\nweapons of violence are their swords.\n^{6 }Let my soul come not into their council;\nO my glory, be not joined to their company.\nFor in their anger they killed men,\nand in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen.\n^{7 }Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce,\nand their wrath, for it is cruel!\nI will divide them in Jacob\nand scatter them in Israel.\n^{8 }“Judah, your brothers shall praise you;\nyour hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;\nyour father\u0026rsquo;s sons shall bow down before you.\n^{9 }Judah is a lion\u0026rsquo;s cub;\nfrom the prey, my son, you have gone up.\nHe stooped down; he crouched as a lion\nand as a lioness; who dares rouse him?\n^{10 }The scepter shall not depart from Judah,\nnor the ruler\u0026rsquo;s staff from between his feet,\nuntil tribute comes to him;[g]\nand to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.\n^{11 }Binding his foal to the vine\nand his donkey\u0026rsquo;s colt to the choice vine,\nhe has washed his garments in wine\nand his vesture in the blood of grapes.\n^{12 }His eyes are darker than wine,\nand his teeth whiter than milk.\n^{13 }“Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea;\nhe shall become a haven for ships,\nand his border shall be at Sidon.\n^{14 }“Issachar is a strong donkey,\ncrouching between the sheepfolds.[h]\n^{15 }He saw that a resting place was good,\nand that the land was pleasant,\nso he bowed his shoulder to bear,\nand became a servant at forced labor.\n^{16 }“Dan shall judge his people\nas one of the tribes of Israel.\n^{17 }Dan shall be a serpent in the way,\na viper by the path,\nthat bites the horse\u0026rsquo;s heels\nso that his rider falls backward.\n^{18 }I wait for your salvation, O Lord.\n^{19 }“Raiders shall raid Gad,[i]\nbut he shall raid at their heels.\n^{20 }“Asher\u0026rsquo;s food shall be rich,\nand he shall yield royal delicacies.\n^{21 }“Naphtali is a doe let loose\nthat bears beautiful fawns.[j]\n^{22 }“Joseph is a fruitful bough,\na fruitful bough by a spring;\nhis branches run over the wall.[k]\n^{23 }The archers bitterly attacked him,\nshot at him, and harassed him severely,\n^{24 }yet his bow remained unmoved;\nhis arms[l] were made agile\nby the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob\n(from there is the Shepherd,[m] the Stone of Israel),\n^{25 }by the Elohim of your father who will help you,\nby the Almighty[n] who will bless you\nwith blessings of heaven above,\nblessings of the deep that crouches beneath,\nblessings of the breasts and of the womb.\n^{26 }The blessings of your father\nare mighty beyond the blessings of my parents,\nup to the bounties of the everlasting hills.[o]\nMay they be on the head of Joseph,\nand on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers.\n^{27 }“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,\nin the morning devouring the prey\nand at evening dividing the spoil.”\nJacob\u0026rsquo;s Death and Burial ^{28 }All these are the twelve tribes of Israel.

There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah\u0026mdash; ^{32 }the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” ^{33 }When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.\n*50* Then Joseph fell on his father\u0026rsquo;s face and wept over him and kissed him. ^{2 }And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. ^{3 }Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.\n^{4 }And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, ^{5 }‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.\u0026rsquo;” ^{6 }And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” ^{7 }So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, ^{8 }as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father\u0026rsquo;s household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. ^{9 }And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. ^{10 }When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days. ^{11 }When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim;[p] it is beyond the Jordan. ^{12 }Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them, ^{13 }for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. ^{14 }After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.\nElohim\u0026rsquo;s Good Purposes ^{15 }When Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” ^{16 }So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: ^{17 }‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”\u0026rsquo; And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the Elohim of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. ^{18 }His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” ^{19 }But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of Elohim? ^{20 }As for you, you meant evil against me, but Elohim meant it for good, to bring it about that many people[q] should be kept alive, as they are today. ^{21 }So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.\nThe Death of Joseph ^{22 }So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father\u0026rsquo;s house. Joseph lived 110 years. ^{23 }And Joseph saw Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph\u0026rsquo;s own.[r] ^{24 }And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but Elohim will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” ^{25 }Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “Elohim will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” ^{26 }So Joseph died, being 110 years old.
