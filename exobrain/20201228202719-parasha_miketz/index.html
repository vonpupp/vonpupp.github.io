<li><p>Joseph Interprets Pharaoh&rsquo;s Dreams</p>

<p>*41* After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the
Nile, ^{2 }and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows
attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass. ^{3 }And behold,
seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and
stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. ^{4 }And the ugly, thin
cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
^{5 }And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven
ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. ^{6 }And
behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east
wind. ^{7 }And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears.
And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. ^{8 }So in the morning
his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of
Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was
none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p>

<p>^{9 }Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I remember my offenses
today. ^{10 }When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the
chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
^{11 }we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with
its own interpretation. ^{12 }A young Hebrew was there with us, a
servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted
our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his
dream. ^{13 }And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was
restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”</p>

<p>^{14 }Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him
out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes,
he came in before Pharaoh. ^{15 }And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had
a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said
of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” ^{16 }Joseph
answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; Elohim will give Pharaoh a favorable
answer.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1212a">a</a>]</sup>
^{17 }Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, in my dream I was standing
on the banks of the Nile. ^{18 }Seven cows, plump and attractive, came
up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. ^{19 }Seven other cows
came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never
seen in all the land of Egypt. ^{20 }And the thin, ugly cows ate up the
first seven plump cows, ^{21 }but when they had eaten them no one would
have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at
the beginning. Then I awoke. ^{22 }I also saw in my dream seven ears
growing on one stalk, full and good. ^{23 }Seven ears, withered, thin,
and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, ^{24 }and the thin
ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians,
but there was no one who could explain it to me.”</p>

<p>^{25 }Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are
one; Elohim has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. ^{26 }The
seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven
years; the dreams are one. ^{27 }The seven lean and ugly cows that came
up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the
east wind are also seven years of famine. ^{28 }It is as I told
Pharaoh; Elohim has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. ^{29 }There
will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,
^{30 }but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the
plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume
the land, ^{31 }and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of
the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. ^{32 }And the
doubling of Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream means that the thing is fixed by Elohim,
and Elohim will shortly bring it about. ^{33 }Now therefore let Pharaoh
select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
^{34 }Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take
one-fifth of the produce of the
land<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1230b">b</a>]</sup>
of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. ^{35 }And let them gather all
the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under
the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
^{36 }That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years
of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may
not perish through the famine.”</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Joseph Rises to Power</p>

<p>^{37 }This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. ^{38 }And
Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom is
the Spirit of
Elohim?”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1234c">c</a>]</sup>
^{39 }Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since Elohim has shown you all this,
there is none so discerning and wise as you are. ^{40 }You shall be over
my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you
command.<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1236d">d</a>]</sup>
Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.” ^{41 }And
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of
Egypt.” ^{42 }Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it
on Joseph&rsquo;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a
gold chain about his neck. ^{43 }And he made him ride in his second
chariot. And they called out before him, “Bow the
knee!”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1239e">e</a>]</sup>
Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. ^{44 }Moreover, Pharaoh said
to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up
hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” ^{45 }And Pharaoh called
Joseph&rsquo;s name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the
daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>^{46 }Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went
through all the land of Egypt. ^{47 }During the seven plentiful years
the earth produced abundantly, ^{48 }and he gathered up all the food of
these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food
in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.
^{49 }And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of
the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p>

<p>^{50 }Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph.
Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
^{51 }Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. “For,” he said,
“Elohim has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&rsquo;s
house.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1247f">f</a>]</sup>
^{52 }The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For Elohim has made me
fruitful in the land of my
affliction.”<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1248g">g</a>]</sup></p>

<p>^{53 }The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came
to an end, ^{54 }and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph
had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt
there was bread. ^{55 }When all the land of Egypt was famished, the
people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians,
“Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”</p>

<p>^{56 }So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all
the
storehouses<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1252h">h</a>]</sup>
and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of
Egypt. ^{57 }Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy
grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Joseph&rsquo;s Brothers Go to Egypt</p>

<p>*42* When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said
to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” ^{2 }And he said,
“Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and
buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.” ^{3 }So ten of
Joseph&rsquo;s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. ^{4 }But Jacob did
not send Benjamin, Joseph&rsquo;s brother, with his brothers, for he feared
that harm might happen to him. ^{5 }Thus the sons of Israel came to buy
among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p>^{6 }Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to
all the people of the land. And Joseph&rsquo;s brothers came and bowed
themselves before him with their faces to the ground. ^{7 }Joseph saw
his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and
spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said,
“From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” ^{8 }And Joseph recognized his
brothers, but they did not recognize him. ^{9 }And Joseph remembered the
dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, “You are spies;
you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” ^{10 }They said to him,
“No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. ^{11 }We are all sons
of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.”</p>

<p>^{12 }He said to them, “No, it is the nakedness of the land that you
have come to see.” ^{13 }And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve
brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the
youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.” ^{14 }But
Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you. You are spies. ^{15 }By
this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from
this place unless your youngest brother comes here. ^{16 }Send one of
you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that
your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the
life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” ^{17 }And he put them all
together in custody for three days.</p>

<p>^{18 }On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live,
for I fear Elohim: ^{19 }if you are honest men, let one of your brothers
remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry
grain for the famine of your households, ^{20 }and bring your youngest
brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.”
And they did so. ^{21 }Then they said to one another, “In truth we are
guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul,
when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has
come upon us.” ^{22 }And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not
to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a
reckoning for his blood.” ^{23 }They did not know that Joseph understood
them, for there was an interpreter between them. ^{24 }Then he turned
away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And
he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. ^{25 }And
Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every
man&rsquo;s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey.
This was done for them.</p>

<p>^{26 }Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
^{27 }And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at
the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. ^{28 }He
said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the
mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned
trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that Elohim has done to
us?”</p>

<p>^{29 }When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they
told him all that had happened to them, saying, ^{30 }“The man, the lord
of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.
^{31 }But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we have never been spies.
^{32 }We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and
the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.&rsquo;
^{33 }Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall
know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and
take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
^{34 }Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are
not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and
you shall trade in the land.&lsquo;”</p>

<p>^{35 }As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man&rsquo;s bundle of money
was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of
money, they were afraid. ^{36 }And Jacob their father said to them, “You
have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no
more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.”
^{37 }Then Reuben said to his father, “Kill my two sons if I do not
bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to
you.” ^{38 }But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his
brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to
him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray
hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”</p></li>

<li><p>Joseph&rsquo;s Brothers Return to Egypt</p>

<p>*43* Now the famine was severe in the land. ^{2 }And when they had eaten
the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them,
“Go again, buy us a little food.” ^{3 }But Judah said to him, “The man
solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your
brother is with you.&rsquo; ^{4 }If you will send our brother with us, we will
go down and buy you food. ^{5 }But if you will not send him, we will not
go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your
brother is with you.&lsquo;” ^{6 }Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly
as to tell the man that you had another brother?” ^{7 }They replied,
“The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred,
saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?&rsquo; What
we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know
that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down&rsquo;?” ^{8 }And Judah said to
Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that
we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
^{9 }I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require
him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let
me bear the blame forever. ^{10 }If we had not delayed, we would now
have returned twice.”</p>

<p>^{11 }Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do
this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry
a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh,
pistachio nuts, and almonds. ^{12 }Take double the money with you. Carry
back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks.
Perhaps it was an oversight. ^{13 }Take also your brother, and arise, go
again to the man. ^{14 }May Elohim
Almighty<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1305i">i</a>]</sup>
grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother
and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am
bereaved.”</p>

<p>^{15 }So the men took this present, and they took double the money with
them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before
Joseph.</p>

<p>^{16 }When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his
house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make
ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” ^{17 }The man did as
Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph&rsquo;s house. ^{18 }And the men
were afraid because they were brought to Joseph&rsquo;s house, and they said,
“It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first
time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us
to make us servants and seize our donkeys.” ^{19 }So they went up to the
steward of Joseph&rsquo;s house and spoke with him at the door of the house,
^{20 }and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.
^{21 }And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and
there was each man&rsquo;s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full
weight. So we have brought it again with us, ^{22 }and we have brought
other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money
in our sacks.” ^{23 }He replied, “Peace to you, do not be afraid.
Your Elohim and the Elohim of your father has put treasure in your sacks
for you. I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
^{24 }And when the man had brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house and given
them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their
donkeys fodder, ^{25 }they prepared the present for Joseph&rsquo;s coming at
noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>

<p>^{26 }When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the
present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground.
^{27 }And he inquired about their welfare and said, “Is your father
well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” ^{28 }They
said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they
bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. ^{29 }And he lifted up his
eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&rsquo;s son, and said, “Is this
your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? Elohim be gracious to
you, my son!” ^{30 }Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew
warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his
chamber and wept there. ^{31 }Then he washed his face and came out. And
controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.” ^{32 }They served him by
himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by
themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for
that is an abomination to the Egyptians. ^{33 }And they sat before him,
the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to
his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.
^{34 }Portions were taken to them from Joseph&rsquo;s table, but Benjamin&rsquo;s
portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were
merry<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1325j">j</a>]</sup>
with him.</p></li>
</ul>

<!--list-separator-->

<ul>
<li><p>Joseph Tests His Brothers</p>

<p>*44* Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men&rsquo;s sacks
with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man&rsquo;s money in the
mouth of his sack, ^{2 }and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of
the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as
Joseph told him.</p>

<p>^{3 }As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their
donkeys. ^{4 }They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now
Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you
overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for
good?<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A1+-+44%3A17&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1329k">k</a>]</sup>
^{5 }Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he
practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.&lsquo;”</p>

<p>^{6 }When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. ^{7 }They said
to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your
servants to do such a thing! ^{8 }Behold, the money that we found in the
mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How
then could we steal silver or gold from your lord&rsquo;s house?
^{9 }Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also
will be my lord&rsquo;s servants.” ^{10 }He said, “Let it be as you say: he
who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be
innocent.” ^{11 }Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground,
and each man opened his sack. ^{12 }And he searched, beginning with the
eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s
sack. ^{13 }Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his
donkey, and they returned to the city.</p>

<p>^{14 }When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&rsquo;s house, he was still
there. They fell before him to the ground. ^{15 }Joseph said to them,
“What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like
me can indeed practice divination?” ^{16 }And Judah said, “What shall we
say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear
ourselves? Elohim has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we
are my lord&rsquo;s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has
been found.” ^{17 }But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so!
Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as
for you, go up in peace to your father.”</p>

<li><p>A Vision of Joshua the High Priest</p>

<p>*3* Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
of YHWH, and
Satan<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+3%3A1+-+4%3A7&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-22914a">a</a>]</sup>
standing at his right hand to accuse him. ^{2 }And YHWH said to Satan,
“YHWH rebuke you, O Satan! YHWH who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is
not this a
brand<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+3%3A1+-+4%3A7&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-22915b">b</a>]</sup>
plucked from the fire?” ^{3 }Now Joshua was standing before the angel,
clothed with filthy garments. ^{4 }And the angel said to those who were
standing before him, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him
he said, “Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will
clothe you with pure vestments.” ^{5 }And I said, “Let them put a clean
turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed
him with garments. And the angel of YHWH was standing by.</p>

<p>^{6 }And the angel of YHWH solemnly assured Joshua, ^{7 }“Thus says YHWH
of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall
rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the
right of access among those who are standing here. ^{8 }Hear now, O
Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for
they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch.
^{9 }For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single
stone with seven
eyes,<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+3%3A1+-+4%3A7&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-22922c">c</a>]</sup>
I will engrave its inscription, declares YHWH of hosts, and I will
remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. ^{10 }In that day,
declares YHWH of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to
come under his vine and under his fig tree.”</p></li>

<li><p>A Vision of a Golden Lampstand</p>

<p>*4* And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man
who is awakened out of his sleep. ^{2 }And he said to me, “What do you
see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl
on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the
lamps that are on the top of it. ^{3 }And there are two olive trees by
it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” ^{4 }And I
said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
^{5 }Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you
not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” ^{6 }Then he said to
me, “This is the word of YHWH to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power,
but by my Spirit, says YHWH of hosts. ^{7 }Who are you, O great
mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring
forward the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!&lsquo;”</p></li>

<li><p>Yeshua Rejected at Nazareth</p>

<p>^{16 }And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was
his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up
to read. ^{17 }And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He
unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,</p>

<p>^{18 }“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br />
    because he has anointed me<br />
    to proclaim good news to the poor.<br />
He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<br />
    and recovering of sight to the blind,<br />
    to set at liberty those who are oppressed,<br />
^{19 }to proclaim the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favor.”</p>

<p>^{20 }And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and
sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
^{21 }And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been
fulfilled in your hearing.” ^{22 }And all spoke well of him and marveled
at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said,
“Is not this Joseph&rsquo;s son?” ^{23 }And he said to them, “Doubtless you
will quote to me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself.&rsquo; What we have
heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.” ^{24 }And
he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
^{25 }But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the
days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six
months, and a great famine came over all the land, ^{26 }and Elijah was
sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a
woman who was a widow. ^{27 }And there were many
lepers<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A16-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-25082a">a</a>]</sup>
in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was
cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” ^{28 }When they heard these
things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. ^{29 }And they rose
up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill
on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the
cliff. ^{30 }But passing through their midst, he went away.</p></li>
