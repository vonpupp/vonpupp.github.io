            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good friend of mine motivated me to write down this post. I am not sure how I
am going to address this in a &ldquo;short&rdquo; way since security and privacy is such a
vast topic. It can be taken to several levels also, so it is a matter of how you
actually compromise in favor of being usable and practical, since the power in
place make it difficult on purpose to have open alternatives that work.</p>
<p>I am going to do my best to divide this in different topics, <strong>keep it short and
non-technical</strong>. It is going to be challenging.</p>
<h2 id="desktop">Desktop</h2>
<p>GNU/Linux is definitively the way to go. Personally I don&rsquo;t trust Microsoft nor
Apple. In general I am an advocate of open source.</p>
<p>Personally I have been using GNU/Linux since around 2000, and I am extremely
comfortable with it. I understand that it could be a challenge where we still
don&rsquo;t have alternatives (or high quality tools) to some specific software like
CAD. But at the same time Linux have better tools in many other aspects.</p>
<p>There are different &ldquo;distros&rdquo; of GNU/Linux. A distro (or distribution) is the
mixture of the tools from GNU, the Linux kernel and a way to manage packages.
This is a very simplistic definition, but I don&rsquo;t want to get too technical
here.</p>
<p>Distributions for the beginners:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSuSE</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> (never tried it)</li>
<li><a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> (never tried it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributions for more mature users:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> (never tried it)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>
<p>Between IPhone and Android, I will always chose Android. The reason being that
Android has a hybrid open/close source development model. It is possible to get
the Vanilla version of Android without google play (actually nothing from
google) and then you can install an alternative to google play like F-Droid or
Aurora Store.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t completely trust Aurora Store because it is a front end of Google Play
itself, and software could have backdoors but I still think it could be a better
alternative than have a phone that you paid for but Google owns.</p>
<p>Just like GNU/Linux, there are several distros. These can com &ldquo;with gapps&rdquo; or
&ldquo;without gapps&rdquo;. Gapps being &ldquo;Google Apps&rdquo;, in other words, Google Play, Gmail,
Google maps, etc. Without gapps is the way I prefer to go personally.</p>
<p>There are several custom roms like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lineage</li>
<li>Resurrection Remix</li>
<li><a href="https://calyxos.org/features/">CalyxOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://grapheneos.org/features">GrapheneOS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most secure focus are Graphene and Calyx. Again, privacy and security is a
deep rabbit hole. As deep as you can afford to go.</p>
<p>Personally I have been using Lineage for years and some custom mods. Every
single Android device that I owned, I flashed and removed the original Android
and replace it with a custom rom without Google Apps (nothing from Google). I
have been doing this since around 2006. I am very curious to try Calyx though.
If I would be starting from scratch, I would go for Calyx.</p>
<p>I have a Mediatek chipset on my phone and I hated it! That was definetively a
bad purchase for this purposes. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the phone is great, but it
is not easier to flash a custom ROM. I would go for Qualcomm chipset instead and
make sure that the bootloader can be changed. <a href="https://www.devicespecifications.com/en/model-cpu/47075c08">This Ulefone Armor 23 looks
promising</a>. Apparently the 24 will also come with a Qualcom chipset.</p>
<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
<p>When in doubt, use a VPN or TOR circuits. In this way your traffic remains more
secure. You can get a router that has that capability already built in, so you
can route everything through that device.</p>
<p>Always use a firewall and disable the services you don&rsquo;t use. Use strong passwords.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an appliance that can do all of that you will need
DD-WRT, pfSense or similar if you want a DIY approach and you are techie enough
or go for a similar commercial solution like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdS1n_F11Dk">the BraxRouter</a> (I am not affiliated
in any way, and I haven&rsquo;t tested it personally so be cautious and do your own
research - DYOR).</p>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>I prefer avoiding using SMS authentication, I don&rsquo;t trust the telephony system.
They have too much power and knowledge about their users.</p>
<p>I also avoid the Google prompts. Those who appears when you are trying to login
on your phone while you are trying to login on your computer. The reason is
simple, they tie your identity on the computer with your phone, because you will
have to &ldquo;click&rdquo; on your phone. All traffic will be related.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Google Authenticator nor Authy, or any Android app for that matter
unless it is opensource. Personally I use one on my computer, this brings extra
security and inconveniences. If I am not with my computer, I cannot login
anywhere, even with my phone. I decided to live with that inconvenience.</p>
<p>Use 2FA (Second Factor Authentication) whenever possible, but with OTP (One TIme
Password) for that. I prefer free TOTP software, the caveat to this approach is
that you will have to handle your secrets yourself in a secure way, so you don&rsquo;t
lose them and nobody else has access to them. Please don&rsquo;t even think about
putting that into Dropbox!</p>
<p>I am a fairly technical guy so I prefer to keep the secrets under my control
having encrypted backups than &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; any other party.</p>
<p>I am not going to disclose publicly here what I use for security reasons. But if
you know me personally and have questions ask me one on one and I will share
more about this.</p>
<p>If you want more information, do your own research. I can point you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChKpf5HjcSY">this video</a>,
as a quick overview. I think the title is a bit missleading though, I trust 2FA
with TOTP where the secrets are encrypted and properly backed up.</p>
<h2 id="im-communications">IM communications</h2>
<p>Signal or no signal&hellip; that is the question&hellip;</p>
<p>I have been a huge fan of Telegram. At the beginning, you did not needed to use
a phone number, it was just an account you created (and you could create as many
as you wanted) and that was it. No verification and no ties to your identity.
Sadly, now they &ldquo;require&rdquo; a phone number, which is by design IMO. So I no longer
trust Telegram. The same argument goes for Signal.</p>
<p>I am aware of Signal&rsquo;s history, even before it was signal and the original
developers, but again&hellip; I don&rsquo;t trust supplying my phone number to any app for
any reason. There is no need for that, none.</p>
<p>I have always hated Whatsapp, security is crappy, it belongs to Meta. Huge user
base&hellip; So many reasons that I wont even go there&hellip;</p>
<p>My preferred method for IM is XMPP which is federated in nature, so &ldquo;no central
points&rdquo; (again, loosely said). I would prefer to pick up a server that is not
crowded, it is in a country outside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the 5 eyes</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In terms of privacy, OMEMO would be preferred, or asymmetric cryptography with
GPG/PGP, or OTR (Off The Record) to say the least.</p>
<h2 id="email-communications">Email communications</h2>
<p>This is a topic that I struggled with for some time.</p>
<p>Bottom line is I don&rsquo;t trust large providers, because they are an easy target. Out</p>
<p>I wrote a note, which is not publicly available analyzing the email providers by
April of 2022. Before that I was using a really old google apps account that I
created around 2005. It was very convenient, I am not going to lie, but I never
felt good about it so it was good that Google decided to kick me out by charging
me. If I have to pay, I prefer to pay for something more friendly towards
privacy than to them.</p>
<p>Here is a table with a summary of some of the criteria that I used to analyze
those providers.</p>

<p>Personally I liked Ctemplar, but I wanted IMAP since I use Emacs/mu4e for email
management and the possibility of keeping a local copy of my emails if needed.
I also use my phone to read emails when needed. So I had to discard them.
Depending on your use you may not need IMAP.</p>
<p>Honestly I am still not comfortable with my email provider, but I am better than
at Google&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In regards to usage, GPG is always preferred but of course it depends on both
parties using it. Be mindful that RSA 2048 is no longer secure, governments can
break into it. Probably not regular people. So I would go for 4096 bit keys.</p>
<p>I am not going to disclose publicly here what I use for security reasons. But if
you know me personally and have questions ask me one on one and I will share
more about this. I know that if you are a technical person you can find this
yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust Zoom. Do your own research here. One of the founders was an
ex-Cisco systems. Again&hellip; do your own research.</p>
<p>I would go for Jitsi or something is open source. Of course a case could be done
that there is always a server as middle man, to which yes, I agree. At this
point I don&rsquo;t know of any better alternatives, Jitsi is the way I would go or
Signal&rsquo;s video chat feature. Even though I don&rsquo;t trust much Signal either.</p>
<h2 id="browsing">Browsing</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Google Chrome, even less Microsoft Edge. I prefer the old Firefox.</p>
<p>As part of my setup I don&rsquo;t save cookies when I close the browser nor history. I
always prefer private mode when possible and I use a bunch of extensions to make
my unique fingerprint not so obvious.</p>
<p>I avoid using google whenever possible. I don&rsquo;t trust much Duckduck go either.
Search engines are the gate keepers of the internet, sadly there is no integrity
in this business. I have read good things about Qwant.</p>
<p>I would advice to also disable Javascript by default by using No Script or
similar. As using other extensions to make your tracking less obvious, even
though I don&rsquo;t think there is much to do here. Try to always use VPNs or TOR
circuits. Be aware that having a high level of privacy/security could make your
browsing experience miserable!</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Well, this is going to be controversial. We don&rsquo;t use money, we use fiat
currency which is controlled by the governments and manipulated via inflation
and taxes as they want. It is hard to get out of that. Cash is always preferred
but it is not convenient, so balancing things out is up to the reader.</p>
<p>Precious metals could be an alternative but probably everything is going to get
digitized in the future, even precious metals probably with certificates on the
blockchain as Colombia is already issuing for real estate. So I don&rsquo;t have good
news here.</p>
<p>Probably having some money in a private crypto currency like ZCash, Monero,
Verge or others could be a good idea. Be mindful of the fluctuations and the
risks about it as the tax compliance.</p>
<p>Also be mindful that you should aim for a peer to peer market and that could be
dangerous also, so you will have to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; the network somehow. If you use an
exchange it defeats the purpose of privacy.</p>
<p>If you go for a private crypto, it is highly likely that you can run a local
node. You can use a small device for such like a Raspberry Pi or a refurbished
mini-desktop or notebook. You will have to setup the service and get a full copy
of the block chain.</p>
<p>Honestly I would hedge for land, food security and water rather than save money.
But that is just my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-communications">Emergency communications</h2>
<p>This is going to be controversial also. I am still learning about radio but I
would definitively have a Ham radio and a rapport team, otherwise the radio
alone is useless. Community is extremely important.</p>
<p>I prefer not to touch much on this subject. Do your own research. Maybe the
Ghost network could help you. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oaWRs2te68">this video on the Lilygo T-Deck device
with the Meshtastic software for Encrypted Comms</a>. And this video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAQI2ZSmxPU">Meshtastic
and LoRa devices</a> for general knowledge. I am fairly new to this, so do your
own research. Not having to use a phone would be preferred IMO, so it is not
tied to the IMEI number, MAC address, IP address and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-closing-remarks">Conclusion and closing remarks</h2>
<p>Remember, favor VPNs or TOR circuits, handle your secrets yourself in a secure
and reliable way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust services where you need to supply personal data. Prefer services
that offer alternative payment methods in crypto also.</p>
<p>As I said in the beginning, privacy and security is a rabbit hole that can go
very deep, even for the technical guy. So I am trying to just give an overview.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am very curious about Hebrew, specially the way the language is hierarchically
designed. Put very simply, three letter words are commonly known as trilateral
roots and the rest of the words are variation of these three letters having a
common root word and having related meaning somehow, thus creating a &ldquo;family&rdquo; if
you will. I am not going to get into these details since it is not the scope of
this post.</p>
<p>Long story short, the journey of trying to learn Hebrew started probably between
2006 to 2008 and I haven&rsquo;t had much success at it. Or lets say that the
expectations don&rsquo;t match reality due to lack of consistent effort on my side.</p>
<p>I thought that I could try to somehow start with the most common words in the
scriptures and that is what motivated <a href="/exobrain/20220601221125-how_to_parse_the_aleppo_codex_and_analyze_its_content_in_python/">to parse the Aleppo codex and analyze its
content in python</a>. I quickly learned that my approach was rather naive given
the prefixes that causes variations to the words, even thought the meaning of
the word itself is the same.</p>
<p>This blog post is a second attempt to tackle the same problem but with a more
sophisticated and accurate approach using Text Fabric.</p>
<p>A corpus of ancient texts and (linguistic) annotations represents a large body
of knowledge.</p>
<p>Text-Fabric is a Python package for processing and access a corpus of ancient
text and linguistic annotations. In this specific case I am using the Hebrew
Bible Database, containing the text of the Hebrew Bible augmented with
linguistic annotations compiled by the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and
Computer from the VU University Amsterdam.</p>
<p>The text is based on the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia edited by Karl Elliger
and Wilhelm Rudolph, Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker, © 1977
and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.</p>
<p>The text-fabric version has been prepared by Dirk Roorda Data Archiving and
Networked Services, with thanks to Martijn Naaijer, Cody Kingham, and
Constantijn Sikkel.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see the work these researchers did compiling all this data and
making it public for free. I am very thankful for it.</p>
<p>I am using a literate programming approach with Doom Emacs and org-mode. This
blog post is a bit more technical oriented. So it is okay if you pass through
the code or if you don&rsquo;t understand some of it.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-virtual-environment">Create the virtual environment</h2>
<p>This snippet will create a virtual environment and install some libs. Due to
some incompatibilities with the word cloud lib, I had to downgrate do Python
3.6.</p>

literate programming the output of the blocks will follow the code. The

<p>These functions will facilitate the processing of the data. The first one will
get the occurrences of a specific type of lexeme. I am not a linguist so I am
learning on the go and I will try to explain it easily. The most common lexeme
verb is <code>אמר</code> (say). It appears 5307 times. We can see that Yah indeed wants to
communicate and instruct us.</p>
<p>A specific instance of that verb has other properties (node features) like
morphology which contains the verbal stem (qal, piel, nif, hif), the verbal
tense (perf, impf, wayq) and gender (m, f) among other information. A lexeme is
the representation of that word (verb in this case) in the broad aspect, i.e
regardless of the verbal stem, tense, gender, etc.</p>

<p>And now lets generate a cloud image for in the Hebrew</p>

<p>To me this is very exciting, with just some lines of code (and of course
standing in the shoulders of giants that made TF possible and the BHSA dataset),
we are able to perform simple tasks like this.</p>
<h2 id="most-frequent-verbs">Most frequent verbs</h2>
<p>I want more, so lets repeat the same procedure but with verbs now. And lets increase the amount of verbs to 100 verbs sorted by frequency.</p>

<p>Here we can see the id of the lexeme (w), the frequency (freq_lex), the utf8
representation of the word without vowel pointing and the english meaning used
for the translation. All automatically, pretty cool isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Now lets create word clouds out of those verbs.</p>
<p>First, the top 30 verbs in Hebrew:</p>

<p>I have noticed something &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; here with vowel pointing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The word
&ldquo;Turn&rdquo; is the bigger one in english, yet is not the most frequent word in the
table. Why is that? Although I am not completely sure about it, I believe it is
due that it appears twice on the list since there are two Hebrew words
translated as turn with different amount of frequencies. I have not taken that
into account in the code. This doesn&rsquo;t happen with the Hebrew words since the
frequency would already be increased in the <code>freq_lex</code> column.</p>
<p>To solve this, I would probably have to parse the pandas dataframe to manually
sum the frequencies of the same english word. But I won&rsquo;t do that right now
since I am more curious about exploring other words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; is rather interesting and I believe it speaks volumes
in itself, since I truly believe that the will of the heart of our Father goes
towards teshuva indeed, turn of our own ways. Seeing this unexpected event was
rather interesting to me.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like working with graphs. I remember a project that I worked a while
ago where I parsed the client requirements relationships into a graph and I
could determine the priorities of modules development based on that. Good
souvenirs. This original idea came from an analysis I did on my social
networks out of curiosity and I could identify and <a href="/posts/20220109211521-finding_communities_on_graphs/">find communities on graphs</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am using org-roam as my notes management app. It is great and it works on
top of org-mode and of course Emacs. Not everyone feels comfortable with this
since it requires to be okay with technical bits and bytes. I just love it&hellip;</p>
<p>I started using v1.0 which did not supported to map org headings but only file
top headers. This was brilliant already enough in itself. With v2.0 org-roam
included the ability to map headers also. What was good became even better! The
only caveat at that time is that org-roam-server stopped working. That is
understandable. Now there is a new project called org-roam-ui which is basically
org-roam-server for v2.0 with headings support.</p>
<p>Recently I trimmed my DB, I am trying to find a balance between using headings
and not using headings. My Emacs default config used to creat UUIDs for each
heading. This was good at first but I had to adapt this for org-roam v2.0&hellip; I
had +9000 notes, which is unpractical to be honest&hellip; So I cleared the UUIDs of
the headers of several files that were not needed and now I have +3000 notes. It
is still too much IMO, so further trimming is needed but that cleanup needs more
thought.</p>
<p>Now lets preview this thing&hellip; Most screenshots have been anonimized.  At the
time of this writing this is how my notes looks like. Keep in mind that out of
all of my notes, only a few selected ones are shared here on my website.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#figure--fig:trading-testing-notes">6</a> shows my simulated trading log. I integrated my
own python tool with yasnippets, so Emacs could get all the goodies out of it.
The result is a very detailed (and possibly overkill) simulated trade log. This
is going to probably be decoupled from my org-roam database. I don&rsquo;t really need
to search on all of that.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was thinking about some practical way of learning hebrew,
something dynamic that tickles my scientist curiosity. And I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t
it be cool if I could parse one of the hebrew codexes and get the top 20 most
frequent words of a chapter or a book? Well this is an attempt to answer these
type of questions.</p>
<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<p>So I rolled my sleeves and I thought: I will google the Aleppo codex in plain
text so I can download it and later use it for analysis. The problem is, I
couldn&rsquo;t find it&hellip;</p>
<p>The next challenge then is, how can I produce a plain text version of the Aleppo
codex? I thought about parsing a mysword module, which are in reality a sqlite
database so that should be easy&hellip; but then when I was doing something totally
unrelated (probably around the bees or my first batch of mead) it hit me&hellip; I
have several bibles from the Sword project already installed on my notebook and
is all OSS, so&hellip; there is probably a python wrapper around diatheke or
similar&hellip; and sure it is =)</p>
<p>If you want the technicalities, go read my note on <a href="/exobrain/20220601221125-how_to_parse_the_aleppo_codex_and_analyze_its_content_in_python/">How to parse the Aleppo codex
and analyze its content in python</a>.</p>
<p>But if you are not a geekie human, you probably are interested only in the
results rather than the bits and bytes. This is why I splitted the whole thing
in two notes, one more IT related and one more Hebrew related. So here we go,
brace yourselves this is probably going to be long.</p>
<p>I am not sure on how to &ldquo;slice&rdquo; the codex so the chunks makes sense for an
analysis, for instance: per chapter? Per book? Per &ldquo;stories&rdquo;? Or even other
slicing like Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim. Since it is not clear I will start
slicing by books at first.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions-and-limitations">Assumptions and limitations</h2>
<p>Hebrew has some peculiarities one of them being the vowel pointing. This brings
a ton of challenges. For the sake of simplicity I had to stick to a codex that
does not include niqqud whatsoever. I am not sure if this is a good approach or
not because two different words without niqqud can render the same writing yet
have totally different meaning.</p>
<p>Another problem is that there are words that are trivially known like לא (h2834)
or אל (h3882); or words that are not translated yet used very much like את
(h7073). I have implemented a filter to have the possibility to skip these
words. Not because they are not relevant, the Aleph-Tav has a ton of secrets and
importance. But there are mixed together some irrelevant tokens considered as
words, like opening and closing brackets and parenthesis or similar. So I
implemented a list to ignore these words that are rather known or really
irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-findings">Interesting findings</h2>
<p>It was rather interesting to me how fast the repetitions decline on unfiltered
words. For instance the most used word is the  את (h854) with 7073 occurrences.
Yet 30 words later in a row, there is a 90% decline in occurrences, משה (h) with
704 occurrences.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The more I try to know, the less I feel I know&hellip; This coding-linguistic area is
fascinating and intreaguing. I feel like a taxonomy of this area is needed.</p>
<p>This will probaly take a lot of time, which I don&rsquo;t have. So I want to try to
balance between being effective and being efficient. I cannot afford to spend
much time with this project but on the other hand the Hebrew language is really
really apealing to me. I have yet to find a balance on how to proceed.</p>
<p>As part of documenting things I am going to include some very interesting
resources that I have found.</p>
<p>From the time I spent researching I would probably go with the BHSA DB. This is
a proposed roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the ETCBC/course materials for an introduction</li>
<li>Check the BHSA/bigTables for Pandas examples and learn how to use it</li>
<li>Reevaluate then</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if focus is more in learning Hebrew, check the Parabible website which
looks really lean and straigthforward.</p>

<p>Recently an upgrade on my notebook went bad and broke something. I wasn&rsquo;t sure
what went wrong but since I had just one system at that time, I had to figure
out how to fix it with the help of my phone. Basically what I did is install
EtchDroid to be able to download an iso and flash it to a flash drive on my
phone directly. Later I could boot form that flash drive, mount the LUKS/LVM
partitions and fix the bootloader. Here is a short how to.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay this is like my fifth attempt to blog and so far, unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>My first couple of blogs were on blogspot around 2005 or so, later I switched to
dokuwiki, which is awesome but it didn&rsquo;t integrated well on my workflow. So I
tried some extensions to try to write directly in markdown but it didn&rsquo;t work
well for me. Then I moved to Hyde, which a Python static website generator. I
invested quite some time customizing everything to my needs and while it was
functional, I had to write in markdown (which I don&rsquo;t like&hellip;). I tried to write
in RST at that time without success.</p>
<p>Then I moved from Vim to <a href="https://gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and discovered <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>&hellip; And yeah, everything
changed&hellip; I love Emacs+Org-Mode and I used quite a lot (and I still use Vim
occasionally).</p>
<p>I wanted to write directly in Org-Mode for my new blog to see if content flows
this time (hopefully) and I can achieve the integration I was looking for all
these years.</p>
<p>The version of this blog uses plain Org-Mode and Hugo with ox-hugo as a middle
helper. So far, so good, I just migrated my old posts which are few in number.</p>
<p>What I am looking forward is to create a mix of a Blog and a digital garden for
my notes (also known as second brain or exobrain).</p>
<p>The rest of the file is actually a sandbox of general Org-Mode formatting to
check out how it renders on Hugo itself.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been using LVM on top of LUKS for more than 2 years without problems.
However since I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to troubleshoot these technologies in
the past I was quite concerned of what would happen when I would have problems.
Today my main computer didn&rsquo;t boot up and I had to fix it manually. This
post shows the steps I performed to recover my system.</p>
<p>I use Arch Linux and I prepared a repository with my custom install method
based on archinstaller. Basically I have a custom partitioning based on LVM on
top of LUKS and some variables to start he installing method.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the parts on this tutorial:</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-overview">Tutorial overview</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a bootable USB and boot the broken system with it (AKA recovery mode**</li>
<li>Chroot into the system</li>
<li>Fix the issue</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>I will assume that the error is similar as mine. After opening the LUKS device,
I had the following problem:
<code>ERROR: device /dev/mapper/storage-root not found</code>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-bootable-usb">Create a bootable USB</h2>
<p>To create a bootable USB you need to download the latest Arch Linux iso and
then us <code>dd</code> to dump it to a flash drive.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">dd <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>4M <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/path/to/archlinux.iso <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sdx <span class="nv">status</span><span class="o">=</span>progress <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> sync
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After completion, use the same flash drive to boot the broken computer. You
generally need to hit a key on the <code>F5</code> - <code>F6</code> range to choose the boot method.</p>
<h2 id="chroot-into-the-system">Chroot into the system</h2>
<p>Once the system has booted, now we need to mount everything the system would
mount on a boot stage.  Adapt the LUKS label and LVM devices according to your
needs.</p>

issue, so let&rsquo;s fix it.</p>
<h2 id="fix-the-issue">Fix the issue</h2>
<p>To fix the issue we basically are going to perform an upgrade an recreate the

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">reboot
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If everything went well, you now should be able to boot the system properly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I was quite worried about how to solve this issue due to the several layers of
complexity: GPT, LUKS and LVM, however everything went out quite smoothly. The
key part is to use a USB flash drive and then mount the boot and root
partitions to recreate the ramdisk.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Spot an error or want to explain something better, feel
free to send me a PR.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Publishing keys is quite common. One nice way to do so is by using the Public
Key Association (PKA) DNS record. Basically this is a record that points to a
file that can be downloaded over the internet. This method is an alternative
(not exclusive) to using keyservers.</p>
<p>One of the problems of keyservers (in my opinion), is the problem of deleting
old keys. I pretty much like the idea of PGP keyserver which verifies
periodically by sending an email if the address is still in use and therefore
maintain that <code>uid</code> of the key. The only problem is that the PGP server is
centralized and it does not use FLOSS standards.</p>
<p>I understand that deleting a key on a distributed environment is hard and
probably maintaining a history of deletions as done actually on most of
keyservers is still a good solution. However since I don&rsquo;t use GPG very often
and I am not publishing my key yet, I wanted to try PKA.</p>
<p>This tutorial is made of two basic parts, first creating a TXT DNS record and
then verifying that the key gets downloaded properly.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-overview">Tutorial overview</h3>
<ol>
<li>Creating the TXT DNS record</li>
<li>Testing the PKA record</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>I assume that you have gpg installed and that you know the basic idea on how it
works, that you know what a private and a public keys are for and how to use
them.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-txt-dns-record">Creating the TXT DNS record</h2>
<p>To create the TXT DNS record you will need to know the fingerprint of the key.
To do so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ gpg --list-keys vonpupp@keybase.io

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In my case, the fingerprint is <strong>F0B9 B3FB 25E9 1209 728E  4844 5368 14BF 4871
A220</strong>, or <strong>0x536814BF4871A220</strong> for short.</p>
<p>Then you need to export the key with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ gpg --export -a 0x536814BF4871A220 &gt; public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then create a TXT record where:</p>
<h2 id="the-name-part">The <code>Name</code> part:</h2>
<p>Is composed of <code>mailbox</code>._pka.albertdelafuente.com. So for
instance if my email is <code>long-anti-spam-email-address@albertdelafuentedotcom</code>,
then the name part should be
<code>long-anti-spam-email-address._pka.albertdelafuente.com</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-text-data">The <code>Text</code> data:</h2>
<p>Contains the <code>fingerprint</code> and the <code>URL</code> where to download the key. In my case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="s2">&#34;v=pka1;fpr=F0B9B3FB25E91209728E4844536814BF4871A220;uri=http://albertdelafuente.com/media/files/public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do not forget to upload the key to match the <code>uri</code> as on the TXT record. In my case:
<a href="http://albertdelafuente.com/media/files/public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc">http://albertdelafuente.com/media/files/public-0x536814BF4871A220.asc</a></p>
<h2 id="testing-the-pka-record">Testing the PKA record</h2>
<p>Once done that you can download the key (just for testing purposes) on another computer or VM as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Test message&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> gpg --auto-key-locate pka -ear mail@albertdelafuente.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In my case this will prompt you with a confirmation since my primary uid does
not match the email. This is made in purpose because I have read that some
spammers are using keyservers to get valid email addresses, therefore I always
use keybase as my primary id.</p>
<p>You will see something similar to this as the output:</p>

<p>As you can see it is not that hard to publish a public key via DNS. You need to
export your key to a file and upload it and then create a TXT record relating
the fingerprint and the location of the key. You may also publish your key on a
keyserver also since not everybody retrieve the keys over DNS.</p>

<p>I have been using LVM on top of LUKS for more than 2 years without problems. However since I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to troubleshoot these technologies in the past I was quite concerned of what would happen when I would have problems. Today my main computer didn&rsquo;t boot up and I had to fix it manually. This post shows the steps I performed to recover my system.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On this post I will show how to configure and use <code>Pacserve</code> and <code>Powerpill</code> on
Arch Linux. On a network of several Arch Linux boxes, it is possible to
configure a <code>Master</code> server which will hold a copy of all the installed packages
within that host and keep it up to date frequently.  The other hosts on the
network can be configured as <code>Slaves</code> and they will download the packages from
the Master whenever possible instead of the Internet directly. The objective is
to save bandwidth and time when using the package manager.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-pacserve-and-powerpill-on-arch-linux">Configuring Pacserve and Powerpill on Arch Linux</h2>
<p>The documentation of <a href="https://xyne.dev/projects/pacserve/">Pacserve</a> explains how it works. This image summarizes
well the behavior.</p>

        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/ox-hugo/Pacserve_Request_Flow_Chart.svg"/> </figure>

<p>Pacserve by itself seems very interesting however I could not make it work
properly. I think it has something to do my router UDP multicast forwarding
support (see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">openwrt-multicast</a>). Nevertheless, I could use it within
<a href="http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/powerpill/">Powerpill</a> which is a pacman wrapper to allow parallel and segmented downloads
through <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/">Aria2</a> and <a href="http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/reflector/">Reflector</a>.  This combo sounds even better, so I will focus on
how to install and use the tree tools together.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some months before I had to import a quite big list of use cases, relationships and requirements data into Enterprise Architect for a project. Of course I didn&rsquo;t do that manually, so I made a hack to do that automatically. Recently I had a new task to accomplish, to split into groups that use case list by their relationships, and once again I thought about doing it automatically since I already have the data structures available and then, I decided: let&rsquo;s play a little bit with the data 8-).</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m not very familiarized with the use case data itself I looked up for a way on how to apply for the same concepts on other areas, and then I came up making some experiments with my Facebook and LinkedIn networks. I learned many things and the results were really interesting.</p>
<p>I first started with my Facebook contacts and this was the initial result</p>



<figure>
    
        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/ox-hugo/fb1-2.jpeg"/> </figure>

<p>Afterward I applied a community detection algorithm (Louvain) with a specific parameter and I could identify 63 groups / communities.</p>



<figure>
    
        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/ox-hugo/fb2-2.jpeg"/> </figure>

<p>Can you see them? Well&hellip; neither do I&hellip; So I applied a atlas layout algorithm so it&rsquo;s visually friendly, and this is the result</p>



<figure>
    
        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/ox-hugo/fb3-800.jpeg"/> </figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to notice that about 46% of my contacts are within the three biggest groups (20.77%, 14.46% and 12.52%). There are also contacts (that multicolored group in the middle) that I couldn&rsquo;t retrieve their connections (probably because a privacy setting). Of course the graphics generated are anonymized, but I&rsquo;m able to identify each group, for instance the bottom middle blue group are my last job work European colleagues. The top right cyan group are some friends from FLOSS communities. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p>On the other hand getting the Linkedin results wasn&rsquo;t that straightforward I had to deal with oauth and the LinkedIn API webservice directly within python. This are the results of my LinkedIn network.</p>



<figure>
    
        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/ox-hugo/linkedin.jpeg"/> </figure>

<p>Some notable groups at first were: bottom left cyan group are again my last work European colleagues, and green my last work Latin America colleagues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This is an amazingly powerful analytics tool that could be used in many areas, probably the most notable  (nowadays) are marketing and social networking. At the same time it&rsquo;s quite scary to see how our privacy goes away, I don&rsquo;t think it would be hard to track somebody having the right information. If I could do this by just examining the relationships imagine what could be possible with some extra data.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been to a talk given by Richard Stallman about how software
patents are useless for the software industry. Since software is applied
mathematics and, it generally needs to combine several ideas to make a new one,
by doing that you could easily infringe a software patent by using one (or more)
of the patented ideas.</p>



<figure>
    
        <img src="https://albertdelafuente.com/home/av/repos/websites/albertdelafuente.com-hugo/static/images/fm_patents.jpg"/> </figure>

<p>He commented that patents are like walking in a mine field, but worst because a
mine ones it blows up it doesn&rsquo;t blows again, patents keeps blowing on and on.
He later highlighted some different scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="a-patent-for-your-idea-not-to-be-stolen-dot-this-is-the-worst-case-scenario">A patent for your idea not to be &ldquo;stolen&rdquo;**. This is the worst case scenario</h2>
<p>You might think that you had a great idea and you want to patent it so no one
will stole your idea. Later a big company comes in and develops something around
your idea. Then something similar will happen&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt; (You) You go there and say: Hey this idea is mine, and I have the patent so you cannot use it!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; (Big company) Ohh, it is a shame&hellip; But let me remind you that within your idea you used some ideas similar to these three patents of us&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt; (oh oh)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; &hellip;and we can find other patents (among our thousands) of us, you might violated with your idea as well&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt; ehmmm</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; &hellip;so in order to no one get hurts, lets make a deal: You give us the right to use your patent and we wont sue you</p>
<p>&gt; Well&hellip; You evaluate (in silence) and remember that they have some good lawyers and a lot of money as well&hellip; And you end by saying: Okay you can use it</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks =D</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: The big company wins.</strong></p>

<h2 id="a-patent-to-protect-yourself-from-others-attacking-you">A patent to protect yourself from others attacking you</h2>
<p>The truth is that it won&rsquo;t protect you unless you find another infringement on the other side that is covered by your patent. A minor company wont sue you anyway since they don&rsquo;t have the resources, and a big one will have very good lawyers to do so and to also defend themselves, so it&rsquo;s a endless legal battle and unnecessary waste of money.</p>
<p>He also pointed that in fact a patent could be also be harmful if you try to defend yourself you don&rsquo;t know how to use it properly, or something is wrong within the patent.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A never ending legal story if someones attacks you, or in the best scenario
nobody will attack you so you won&rsquo;t really need the patent in first place.</p>
<p>Later he also made a symbolism about software and music which personally I found
very interesting. &ldquo;Imagine that when Beethoven was alive the whole patent idea
arose and somebody patented parts of musical pieces. Then some beautiful
compositions would never been made. It&rsquo;s easier to compose for the beauty of
doing so than composing with the worry of not getting sued&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The whole speech makes a lot of sense while patents in software don&rsquo;t.</p>
